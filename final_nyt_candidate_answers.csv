1,1,"In an ideal world, would anyone own handguns?","Yes, but in an ideal world, Donald Trump would not be our President.","In an ideal world anyone who owned a gun would know how to make sure they were safe and would use them responsibly. I believe in our Constitution, so I respect the Second Amendment, but we have to handle guns in an entirely different fashion in this country. And there’s such clear American majorities for things like background checks and ensuring that there are appropriate waiting periods and making sure that guns do not fall in the hands of people who are ready to do harm to themselves or others. So I believe in our Constitution, but I think, in the ideal world, gun ownership would be treated very, very differently.","You know, when people bring up gun violence in this country, it immediately becomes very personal to me, because I live in one of those communities that’s seen horrific realities of our children being killed at levels that are unconscionable. We have, in my short lifetime, more people that have died by gun violence than all the wars in America, from the Revolutionary until now, combined. We have a nation where it doesn’t even seem to notice anymore, the carnage that you see in communities across this country, like mine. I had a shooting just days ago in Newark, and a reporter who was there moments before, a block away, moments before the shooting texted me and said, “I can’t find any mention of it online.” And I got very angry and I said, “That’s because we live in a country right now that doesn’t even seem to take notice of inner city murders.” We need to change this uniquely American problem that we’re now seeing in every corner of our society, and what have we done? People die in synagogues, we do nothing. People die in churches, and we do nothing. People die at concerts, and we do nothing. And every day, 100 people die to gun violence and we do nothing. So, as president of the United States, I’m going to bring a fight to this problem like folks have never seen before, because I know the pain in communities like mine, the ripping of the fabric, the reverberating of the violence, the trauma that stays in communities that know gun violence, the lives that are destroyed. Enough is enough in our country. We will end this crisis by doing the kind of common-sense things that will make our nation safe, and this debate will not be dictated by the corporate gun lobby. It will be dictated by Americans that know we can do things that make our nation so much safer, so much stronger. Governments are formed for the defense of their people. It’s one of the fundamental things said in our founding documents, and we’re failing that call. I will step up to this challenge, and we will solve this problem.","Yes. I mean 40 percent of households have firearms in them. Every legal firearm owner that I know wants to keep themselves and their family safe and guns not falling into the wrong hands. So, I don’t think that in an ideal world, there are people that, all they do is target-shoot, all they do is hunt. That’s what I do. So, it’s not that we should deny them the right to have a firearm. What we do is, we need to make sure that our families and our communities are safe. Because I think the values are the same, non-firearm-owners and those that own firearms. They want to keep their family, their community and themselves safe. If we ever look at this as a public safety issue, instead of a political issue, I think that we could go a long ways.","Well, in an ideal world, nobody would feel the need. But I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the desire of people to have a means of self-defense, as long as there are common-sense measures, as we have around every American and every constitutional right, from freedom of speech, to freedom of religion, to make sure that it does not harm Americans. And that’s the debate that’s playing out right now when it comes to common-sense gun safety.","In an ideal world, people would not own handguns. And there are a number of countries around the world where people do not own handguns, where they’re not permitted. And we see that those countries have more safety, greater safety, less violent deaths and so forth. However, we also recognize in the United States that the Supreme Court in the Heller decision has ruled that people do have a right to bear arms. And so for the time being, what we need to do is make sure that we make the possession of firearms as reasonable as possible. I believe in common-sense gun reform, in limiting the capacity of magazines, in universal background checks, in a 21st-century updated assault weapons ban. But we also need to go further than that. We need to invest in things like gun buybacks. Because what we’re dealing with right now, what our attention has been focused on, largely, has been these mass shooter incidents. But really, if you look at it, that’s not the majority of the gun violence that happens in our country. We need things like gun buybacks. We need to roll back some of these laws around campus carry, for instance, that I believe make our public spaces more dangerous. And so, I would not only pursue what we often think of as common-sense gun reform, but I would also look at really addressing this issue in other, also effective ways.","Well, we don’t live in an ideal world. We live in a country where we have the Second Amendment, which I support. So that gives the American people the right to bear arms, and under the Second Amendment, they have the right to bear handguns. But, I do think that’s not an unlimited right. I think we can put in place common-sense gun safety provisions that involve things like universal background checks and the limitation on certain kind of high-powered military style weapons and things like red flag laws, but that’s the world we live in.","I support our Second Amendment rights, and people’s choice to whether or not they want to own handguns or not.","I’m not opposed to gun ownership. What I am opposed to is gun violence. And the reason why I’ve worked so hard to end gun violence is because I’ve met parents who have lost children, wives who have lost husbands, people who have lost the people they love the most. And I can tell you, the problem we have is an N.R.A. that is dominated by greed. The N.R.A. does not represent law-abiding gun owners anymore. They represent gun manufacturers. And because of their advocacy, they want to sell weapons to people on the terror watch list, who are gravely mentally ill with a violent background, and people with criminal records for violent crimes. Because that’s why they oppose a universal background check. They aren’t willing to ban bump stocks or large magazines, or assault rifles and assault weapons, and they’re not even willing to have a federal anti-gun-trafficking law. So I oppose the N.R.A.’s advocacy because it’s all dominated by gun sales. They care more about their profits than they care about people, and that is the definition of greed. So we need to hold the gun manufacturers accountable, and I think what the youth movement is doing today is extraordinary. I think advocates like Emma Gonzales are changing the narrative, and I want to lift up their voices to make sure that they are heard, to begin to shame members of Congress who will not hold the N.R.A. accountable and will not hold the gun manufacturers accountable.","In an ideal world, there would be no gun violence. And, listen, I support the Second Amendment, but we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, and the fact that United States Congress has failed to have the courage to reject a false choice, which suggest you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment, or you want to take everyone’s guns away, is irresponsible. It’s the height of irresponsibility. I strongly believe that supposed leaders need to have the courage to understand that we need to be practical on this. We need to pass smart gun safety laws, starting with universal background checks, and with a renewal of the assault weapons ban.","Well, in an ideal world, you could philosophize it that no one wants handguns. I think that the notion that so many people have that a handgun makes them safer, it’s a little bit like people’s health care insurance through their business. It is something that they accept and believe in. That being said, study after study after study shows that having a handgun, in most cases, makes you less safe, not more.","I think that in a world that I can foresee, that law enforcement personnel that are trained and are protecting us, certainly are going to be needed. And I do believe that there is some right, privately, for firearms. But I have been a person who cast one of the pivotal votes to pass the assault weapon bill in 1994. I lost my seat in part because of that, but I have never regretted that vote, because it was the right vote. And now I can tell you we’ve got the N.R.A. on the run in Washington State. We’ve passed three of the strongest gun safety laws in the United States, and we have more to do. So, I’m committed to common-sense gun safety, which ought to be a top priority for the United States, and I am proud to continue the work that we’ve done in Washington State to make that national. I believe we need to and can do that with the next president.","I have never come out for banning guns, but I think we have to do a much better job of getting guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them. This is the issue of our time and the issue of this new generation. When I was in law enforcement, way back then, I was for an assault weapon ban. And police chiefs, district attorneys, we were unable to get that done. Then I got to the Senate. Sandy Hook happened, massacres happened, 30 kids a day getting killed when you look at a lot of the shootings across our country, every day, on the streets. And yet, we were not able to pass that universal background check bill that two A-rated N.R.A. senators put forth. That was a sad day, that the Senate didn’t have the courage to do it. But now, we have a new generation. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year olds, that’s the best thing that could ever happen. Since Parkland, kids across the country have been ignited on this issue. So as president, I will ensure that we get universal background checks done, that we get the boyfriend loophole fixed, if we don’t get it fixed, bump stock ban, you name it. I think we have to do a better job, not of banning guns — and I come from a state with a proud hunting tradition where, literally, I look at all these proposals, and I say, “Does this hurt my Uncle Dick in the deer stand?” None of these proposals I’ve discussed, including an assault weapon ban, does that. We need to get these bills done.","In an ideal world, we would not have weapons of war on our streets. That’s the bottom line. I’m someone who had to use guns. Every day in Iraq I walked around with an assault rifle and a handgun at the very least. And, so, I’ve seen the destruction that guns can cause. So, while I respect the Second Amendment, there’s no need for weapons of war on our streets or in our schools. I’ll use the credibility of someone who understands guns, who has used guns, someone who can even say “guns saved my life,” to fight to make our community safer. REPORTER: What about handguns, not a weapon that’s an exclusively military weapon? MOULTON: Well, I mean, look, that’s a discussion that we should have and a debate that we should have in the United States. I mean, the fact of the matter is that handguns cause a lot of deaths around the country. And we can have a good debate about whether they should be allowed to be free. But the easy ones are these assault rifles that are clearly weapons of war. Gosh, if you need an assault rifle to go hunting, then I think you need some hunting lessons. Assault rifles have been used to perpetrate some of the worst massacres of gun violence here at home and around the globe, and we should start with outlawing them.","I think in an ideal world, our country would do a much better job of protecting the lives of our fellow Americans. We would ensure that anyone who wants to buy a handgun, or any weapon, goes through an extensive background check, to prevent those who are a danger to themselves or to others from owning and using those weapons. I think in an ideal world, we would stop selling weapons of war into our communities, where they so often show up in our schools, in our concerts, in our churches, in our synagogues, in our public life. We would have red flag laws to ensure that those who own weapons and are a danger to someone in their lives, or to themselves, are stopped before it is too late. In an ideal world, we would listen to people instead of political action committees and the gun lobby and the N.R.A. And I think we can get closer to that ideal world in an administration that will listen to people and put their lives and concerns first.","I believe that law-abiding citizens do have the right to protect themselves. Some people that are law-abiding citizens, they live in tough neighborhoods, and there may be crime, and they want to protect their family. I believe they have the right to do that, if they’re not a criminal, if they’re not a terrorist, and they meet the standards that we set as a society, I believe people have the right to protect themselves.","Coming from a state where a whole lot of people own guns and people enjoy target-practicing and so forth, yeah, I think if used in a sportsman-type way — yeah, I think that would be acceptable. But, having said that, I mean, right now we’re looking at an epidemic of gun violence in this country. Some 40,000 people, many of them suicides, 40,000 deaths took place last year from guns. Clearly we need to deal with the epidemic of gun violence, and I very strongly believe that we have to go forward into what we call common-sense gun safety legislation, and that is extending background checks, it means doing away with the gun show loophole. It means basically making sure that people who should not own guns do not own guns. From way back when, I was someone who believed that automatic weapons — which, military-style weapons — should not be sold or distributed to the civilian population, and that’s my view today. I think we should ban the sale and distribution of automatic weapons.","I have no problem with people owning handguns. I want to make sure that we keep the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people. That means to me, background checks, that means banning and buying back 15 million assault rifles, weapons of war that have no business in our community, investing in gang violence prevention programs. But keep your pistols, keep your shotguns, keep your rifles. If you want to go hunt with your family, shoot for sport, or protect your house, that’s in our Constitution and you’re allowed to do that. I just happen to believe that this unrestricted weaponry that’s out there is making our kids less safe in their schools, and parishioners less safe in our churches and synagogues and mosques, and that we could do a lot more to make them safer.","Sure. There are people who own guns. I understand that. My family had guns when I was growing up. My brothers have guns. There are people who like to target-shoot and there are people who have guns for safety reasons. But, boy, we need to be a country that’s not held hostage by the N.R.A., and we need to have better gun safety laws in place, serious laws that protect us and protect our children. Statistically speaking, today, seven children will die from gun violence. And it will happen again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. Some of these will be mass shootings, but some will just be a kid on the sidewalk, a kid at the playground. If seven of our children were dying from some mysterious virus, boy, we’d be all over that. We’d be calling in the researchers and trying to figure out what we needed to change. We need to do the same with guns. We have a moral responsibility to protect our children and that starts with better gun safety laws.","I am not for messing with the Bill of Rights. And the Second Amendment is the right to bear arms. Now, as we know, of all the times of the founders have become unclear, that clause about for the purposes of a well-organized militia — I believe in strong, common-sense gun safety laws. There should be universal background checks. There should be outlawing of bump stocks. There should be no high-speed magazines. There should be no — I do not believe that military assault rifles should be available to the average person. And I am, even now, processing this issue of gun registration. But, no, I believe that we have the right to bear arms in the United States, and I am not arguing for the repeal of the Second Amendment.","I’m for gun safety. I think we should treat firearms the same way we treat motor vehicles, where if you have a motor vehicle and you use it poorly, you can kill someone, and so we have testing and licensing. And so we should be testing and licensing for firearms in the same way. And if you look at when someone buys a handgun, one of the most common victims of a crime will be the owner him- or herself, where often when people get depressed they will drink and then the handgun, if it’s there, ends up leading to tragedy. So in my ideal world, firearms would be much, much more judiciously owned and we would know what was happening when someone buys a gun, it’s not like you just walk in and pick one up on a lark. But the right to bear arms is in the Constitution and there are 300 million guns in the United States right now. We’re the most heavily armed society in the history of the world. So talking about a future where no one owns a handgun is, frankly, not going to match up with reality in any reasonable timeframe."
2,2,Would your focus be improving the Affordable Care Act or replacing it with single payer?,"I think that we should finish the work that we started with the Affordable Care Act by having a robust public option for people to have the alternative to buy something other than private insurance. My plan, Medicare X, would be administered by Medicare and be available to everybody in America who wants to make a change. I think that is the way we'll get to universal coverage fastest.","We have to go a lot farther when it comes to health care. I want to see a universal health care system, just like we're doing here in New York City, where we're now guaranteeing health care for everyone who doesn't have health insurance. Look, it's so clear to me, when I talk to everyday people around this country, so many of them don't have health insurance. A lot of them that do have health insurance, they can't use it. They've got the premiums and the deductibles and the co-pays and the out-of-pocket expenses, and it becomes health insurance that's no longer workable. A lot of folks don't seek health care because it's too hard to navigate or there's too many hidden costs. And a lot of folks who even have insurance, if, God forbid, they have a serious medical problem, it can throw their whole family for a loop, their whole budget for a loop. So, look, what we have now is just not enough of a health care system. It's also a health care system that only addresses physical health most of the time. It doesn't even pay any attention to mental health, and mental health is a huge challenge for most American families. So look, I say, in the end, we need a universal health care system. I think the “Medicare for all” model is the pathway that gets us there. But we cannot continue on the current path we're on because what this means is, some people get health care and a lot of folks don't.","I don't see ... I don't see in any way that those two are mutually exclusive. I think the first thing a president needs to do when they get in office is stop the vandalism and the sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, to stabilize it. What we've seen is from a height of the Obama era, where you had expanded access, now we're seeing that access start to decline and costs going back up. And so, the first things I'll do is to stop that sabotage, is re-turn on some of the payments that were helping to stabilize it. Helping more people to sign up, because we actually took money away from even those efforts to try to get more people to sign up in the marketplaces. In addition to that, though, I'm going to fight to try to expand access through things like creating a more vibrant, robust public option. I think we need to move down Medicare eligibility, for example, as our way to move towards having everyone have access to public option, and, I think, everyone having access to health care. As a former chief executive, I know you can't hold hostage progress for some ideological purity. We need to work towards those goals, that's why I will fight for Medicare for all, but in the early days of my presidency, my day-to-day work is to get more and more people access to health care. Because every single person or family that gets access, it makes transformative changes in their lives. And so, I will do what's necessary, every day, to get more people access to health care and to lower costs for everyone.","My focus would be building off of the Affordable Care Act and improving it. And what I've seen and what I've done — the last two and a half years we've had an assault in Washington, D.C., on things like pre-existing conditions, even costs when it comes to health care. In Montana, I focused on ... everyone should have access and health care should be affordable, affordable both for the individual and, indeed, for the federal government. And I think we can get to access and affordability without disrupting 150-plus million people that have private insurance right now with access to a public option, automatic enrollment. There's about 14 million people right now that could qualify for either subsidies or Medicaid expansion, but don't. Negotiating prescription drug prices. Ending surprise billing and out-of-network billing. In a state like ours, even with a 60 percent Republican legislature, just by expanding Medicaid, we not only gave 10 percent of our population health care that didn't have it, but of that 100,000, 30,000 are now getting mental health care, 10,000 substance use disorder treatment. Everyone should be able to have access to affordable care. And there's a lot of ways to get there.","I think we need to move toward single-payer. And the way I've proposed to do it is a kind of “Medicare for all who want it.” It's an option, a version of Medicare, made available for people to buy into. Now, that's going to take a little while to kick in, so we shouldn't waste any time shoring up the A.C.A. I just don't think that it's enough for the long run. REPORTER: And what about the short term? BUTTIGIEG: In the short term, we need to stop the assault on the A.C.A. That's what this administration is undertaking right now. They may claim that they're not trying to take away, for example, your pre-existing condition coverage, but that's flatly untrue, at a moment when this administration is seeking to dismantle the A.C.A. in its entirety. We need to shore up what we have, but it's also an example of why we need universal health care, so that they can never successfully mount an attack like this again. Because they would not frontally attack universal health care enjoyed by so many Americans when it's fully up and running.","We need a new system. I grew up with a grandmother who had diabetes. As I grew older and she grew older, her condition got worse and worse until eventually, before she passed away, she had to have one of her feet amputated. But we were fortunate that she had Medicare. I want to make sure that Medicare is there for everybody in this country.","I think both, because I think what we should do right away is improve the Affordable Care Act, and then I think we should begin the conversation with the American people about how we create universal health care. I don't believe a single-payer system is the right way to create a universal health care system. I think there are better ways, I think I have a better way of creating a universal health care system, which is to give everyone health care as a right of citizenship, from when they were born to they’re 65, then when they're over 65, they go into Medicare. But, as part of getting your basic government health care, you can opt out of it if you want, and get a small tax credit and then use that to buy your own health care, or you can buy supplemental programs like folks do in Medicare. What I envision is a basic government market as a right that everyone gets as a part of citizenship, and then there be a robust private market that kind of floats on top of that. I think that's a much better market because I think it gives the American people choice, and I also think it leads to higher-quality health care and more access to health care. Because the problem I have with the single-payer system is that there's no evidence that the government actually ever pays enough for health care. Because right now, the government only pays 80 percent of the costs for Medicaid. It pays 95 percent of costs for Medicare. And private insurance pays about 115 or 120 percent of cost. So if the government were the only payer in health care, it's not clear to me that they’d ever pay costs, because we have ample evidence to suggest they won't, and that will lead to a reduction in quality and in access. So what I favor is fixing the Affordable Care Act. I want to do that in my first hundred days as president, because I think it was a good law and I think there's things to do to shore it up and make it better for the American people. But then I want to begin a discussion about how we create universal health care so that every American has health care as a right, because I think it is a basic human right, and I also think it's smart economic policy. I was an entrepreneur. I would have never been able to start my business but for the fact that my wife was working and she had health care at her job. So many Americans are shackled to their job because of health care. I want to kind of liberate them in many ways. If they want to start a business, great. If they want to get more skills and try to get a better job, terrific. I don't want them to be stuck in their job because of health care.",I support “Medicare for all.” I think the current system that we have continues to be broken even with the advances made in the Affordable Care Act. There are still far too many people in this country who are uninsured or who are underinsured and ultimately are not able to get the care that they need.,"I believe in “Medicare for all” because I think health care is a right and not a privilege, and one of the challenges we've had with the A.C.A. is, we never got to universal coverage that was affordable. So I think the best way to do that is through “Medicare for all” and ultimately having a single-payer that is an earned benefit just like Social Security today, where everyone buys in at a price they can afford, matched by their employer, and you buy in your whole life.","Well, I don't think we have to accept that false choice. Let's first agree that the Affordable Care Act took us to a place where tens of millions of people for the first time had access to health care. And it was revolutionary, frankly, what they were able to achieve in terms of improving and reforming the health care system. I think we now need to take it to the next step, because still in our country, so many people do not have access to affordable health care. My goal, and I think the best place that we could be, is to have “Medicare for all.” And I support “Medicare for all.” And the other part of it is that we have to have policies in our country that recognize that one of the biggest barriers — in fact, the biggest barrier — to everyone having access to health care is cost. And we have got to be focused on reducing, and in some situations eliminating, the cost. Public health should be an issue that is not a political issue. We should know that access to health care should be a right, and not a privilege for those who can afford it, and I support everything that we need to do to get to a place where people don't have to make decisions about whether they can relieve their pain or receive access to health care based on how much money they have.","I think the first thing that most Democrats agree on is that we need to get to universal health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege. Then you have to decide what the best way to get to universal coverage is. And I think once we get the White House and get Congress, we could get universal coverage and adjust. If we're going to go to Medicare for all, right now there's 160, 165 million people that have private insurance mostly through their business. More than two-thirds of those people are happy or very happy with the insurance they have. They're not going to want to give it up. I think any transition has to recognize that those people who have a health care system that works for them should be accommodated, and that the new system should allow a smooth transition for everybody. REPORTER: Is there a very short version of that, that we could use? Sort of like “improve it or replace it”? HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think we need universal coverage. Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and to get there, we're going to need a lot of the systems that are in place now, but we're going to have to enhance them in significant ways.","I would move forward with the success we've had in Washington, and I'm proud that we had the first public option in the United States. And now we need universal health care. And that means moving forward with Medicare for all who want it, reducing the age of eligibility, and helping more people get health care like we've done in the state of Washington. REPORTER: That sounds like replacing it with universal health care is then your stance? INSLEE: We need universal health care in the United States, we need to build on my success as the first governor to adopt a public option and move to a “Medicare for all who want it” program. I believe that's the future for health care in America.","My focus would be building on the Affordable Care Act. The first thing we have to do is to protect it from the Republicans, who are trying to kick people off their insurance if they have pre-existing conditions. They just filed a brief down in a case in Texas where they are basically trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So we need to keep it in place, but it is a beginning and not an end. I would work immediately to bring premiums down and to expand health care to universal access. How do you do it? Well, first you do it with something called reinsurance and cost-sharing that I think could pass very quickly, and then you have a public option so that people can choose. Maybe you could do it with Medicaid, ou could do it with Medicare, so that they have an option where there's not a lot of middlemen making money off of them. And then, finally, the Affordable Care Act did not do enough when it came to pharmaceutical prices. I would take on pharma big time. They have two lobbyists for every member of Congress. They think they own Washington, but they don't own me. For years, I've been leading the bills for negotiation for Medicare prices, for bringing less expensive drugs in from places like Canada that are safe, and also for stopping the horrendous practice where pharma pays off their competitors, generic companies, to keep their products off the market. That's wrong, and when I am president, we will get these bills done.","My focus would be on improving the Affordable Care Act, but we need to make some significant improvements, because there are a lot of people who still do not have access to quality, affordable health care. I think I'll be the only person in this race who gets single-payer health care, because I made a commitment to continue getting my own health care at the VA when I was elected to Congress. And the fact of the matter is that it's a far from perfect system. I've seen firsthand some of the challenges with the single-payer system. So, I think health care is a right. I think everybody in America deserves access to health care. If that means Medicare, or, even better, a successor to Medicare that everybody can have for free if they want it, that is great. But I'm not going to force people to get rid of their private health care plans if they like them.","My focus is on ensuring that we have guaranteed high-quality health care for every single American, that it is universal for every child, for every woman, for every man in this country. We can begin by improving the Affordable Care Act, but we have to go far beyond that. The plan that I am supporting is “Medicare for America,” that guarantees that everyone who does not have care today is able to enroll in Medicare. Those who have insufficient health care, meaning they can't afford their premiums, or bridge their deductibles, or make the co-pay on their prescription medications or their doctors’ visits, they can choose to enroll in Medicare as well. And those who have employer-sponsored insurance that they like, because it works for them and their families, are able to keep that as well. That is the surest, quickest path to guaranteeing that everybody has high-quality care in the United States.","We need to move towards a single-payer system. I think the natural next step is to have some public option for people to be able to buy affordable, accessible, quality health care. We tried really hard during the Obamacare debates to get the public option in. I think that is the natural next step for us to take.","The United States today is the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. Our current system is dysfunctional. It leaves 34 million people uninsured and even more underinsured. We pay the highest prices in the world by far for prescription drugs, and at the end of all of that we spend twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other nation. This system is not working. Clearly we need to replace it with a popular system, and that is Medicare, and expand Medicare to all. So, I believe in a “Medicare for all,” single-payer program.","As president, I will seek a coverage-for-all system that says if you're sick, you're seen, if you're seen, you won't go broke. It would be a public option to drive down the prices in the private insurance market, but also to strive to find cures in our lifetime. To invest public dollars in genomics, targeted therapies and data sharing as a way to increase the quality of life, decrease the costs, and create a lot of new jobs in the meantime. REPORTER: So, fair to say you would not be a “blow it up and replace it” kind of guy? SWALWELL: I'm a coverage-for-all candidate, so I want every person who needs coverage to be able to get it through the government if that's the option they choose. If you want","Yes, look, and in fact, I'd be focused on three things. The first is, we need to defend the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans are still attacking it — lawsuit down in Texas, HHS is doing everything they can to take the legs out of it. Second thing we need to do: We need to pick off the things that are easy, reduce the cost of prescription drugs. I've got a bill to reduce the cost of generic drugs. We need a consumers’ bill of rights for insurance, private insurance, so that people don't get ripped off. Same kind of deal I set up for credit card companies. That's part two. And part three, we’ve got to keep moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost. And there are a lot of different ways to get there. “Medicare for all” has a lot of different paths for how we get there. But ultimately it's about making sure that we all adhere to the basic principle. Health care is a basic human right. It is our collective responsibility to make sure everybody gets coverage at the lowest possible cost. And Medicare: best way to get there.","I think the wisest thing for us to do is to have a “Medicare for all”-type plan as a public option, and then to give people the opportunity also to keep their private insurance, if they want it. I know there are a lot of people who disagree with that, who feel that we need to just go straight on, all “Medicare for all,” nothing else, right away. But, for myself, as president, I want to be an agent of change, but not an agent of chaos. And I believe that even though we need to definitely navigate some fundamental shifts, fundamental pattern disruptions to the economic and political status quo in this country, we want to do so carefully, and causing as little personal disruption for people as possible. REPORTER: That sounds a bit like, sort of somewhere in the middle. WILLIAMSON: It's a Medicare ... Definitely, definitely, the issue here is to have universal health coverage for every single American.","My focus would be on replacing it with “Medicare for all,” a system that provides health care to all Americans. I think that the Affordable Care Act was a tremendous step forward, but did not go quite far enough."
3,3,Do you think it’s possible for the next president to stop climate change?,"I think we, as a country, leading the world, need to stop climate change. We need to make sure that temperatures don’t increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. We need no net new carbon by 2050. I think that is all well within our ability as humans I think that Americans should lead the way. REPORTER: Do you think the president, whoever that is, could do that, could stop it? BENNET: I do. I think that, in order to create a durable solution though, you can't do it two years at a time. It can't be one party does it for two years, the other party rips it out after that. We need a proposal that's broadly supported by the American people and drives economic growth at the same time we're dealing with climate change and I think we can do it. I'm absolutely convinced we can.","I think the next president has to take the lead in stopping climate change and yes, I think it can be done, but it’s going to take an entirely different approach. My city went through pain, so much suffering because of Hurricane Sandy. Dozens of people were lost in Hurricane Sandy. Billions of dollars of damage. I always say after Hurricane Sandy, there’s not a lot of climate deniers left in New York City. It’s clear to me the federal government has to lead the way with the Green New Deal. With the kinds of things we’re doing in New York City, right now, we’re moving our government car fleet to electric vehicles, we’re putting up electric charging stations all over city. We’re mandating that buildings have to be energy efficient. If not, we’re going to fine them. We’re divesting from fossil fuels. Five billions dollars in divestment from fossil fuels. We’re making sure that money is put into renewable energy investments. These are the kinds of things that should be happening on a vast scale with our federal government. The United Nations says we have 12 years to start to fix things. I believe that’s a real timeline we have to honor. We can do it if we take the full force of the federal government and devote it to the Green New Deal. And I’ve done it here in New York. I’ve proven it can be done in the biggest city in the country, in a tough environment, we’re proving these things really do work, they can work. We need to do it across our whole nation.","I think it’s possible for us to stop climate change. I think we gotta get away from this idea in America that think that our presidents are going to somehow be saviors. I’ve been telling people time and time again in this election that if you vote for me, I’m going to put a warning label that I’m going to be have to ask for more from you. Because what we’re doing right now is not enough. All of us have to be a part of the solution, and that means taking responsibility for the problems. That means actually admitting that there is a crisis, and we’ve got to understand that America can do so much more boldly, courageously, like we’ve done in past generations, to tackle global problems. But we can’t do it alone. We need to do it in partnership with others on the planet. That’s why the first thing I’m going to do, one of the first things I do in the hours I am president, will be rejoin the Paris accords, climate accords, and start to lead with every lever that I have, from diplomacy to foreign aid — every lever that I have — to make sure that we as a planet, that we as a human species, tackle this problem together, and end the crisis of climate change, which we have to face with a sense of urgency right now. And again, it’s not going to be one person in one office, it has to be a movement, a renewed commitment in our country and across this planet.","I do think it’s possible for the next president to finally take the steps to at least address climate change. I mean, all of the scientists say we need to do this over three decades. What we’ve seen so far though, is, first to step back, I think even George H.W. Bush 30 years ago said, we’ll actually... “We’ll take on the greenhouse effect with a White House effect,” meaning leadership will start from the top. And unfortunately because of the outside and the corrupting influences of dark money, Republicans can’t even acknowledge that climate change is human-caused. Coming from Montana the second worst fire season of my state’s history two years ago, farmers have different planting cycles, come to Glacier Park now cause it may be gone. So I do think the next president can lead, and we have to lead both globally and at home, pulling out of Paris when ultimately the U.S. can’t do this alone. We emit about half the greenhouse gases as China. We need to reinstate our international role, taking back, when the Trump administration rolled back cafe standards, not even the auto companies were asking for this. What I’d do is, I’d ultimately convene both conservationists, business, labor, scientists and say let’s have the short term path to make sure that we can hit these emissions reductions and over the next couple of decades, how can we get so that we are carbon neutral as a nation and indeed this world.","I think it’s possible for the next president to reverse the trajectory toward climate ruin that we’re on today. Can he do it in four years? Of course not. But that’s exactly why we need to act with the most urgency ever. This is a generational project. It’s going to have to be a national project. A good president will not only implement policies, but set the tone so that the public, and private, and social, and academic sectors of this country are all pulling in the same direction, and leading the world to do the same.","Yes, I think it’s possible for the next president to have a dramatic impact not only on how the United States combats climate change, but how the world does that. My first executive order, if I’m president, would be to recommit the United States to the Paris climate accord, so that we lead again on climate change. On top of that, I believe that we need to make massive investments in renewable energy, and in bringing down carbon emissions. I like the concept of a Green New Deal. I believe that we don’t have to choose between protecting our planet and growing jobs and growing our economy. We can do both of those things. One person alone can’t stop climate change, but this nation can lead. And it can get other nations around the world to be leaders. Doing that together, I’m confident that we can effectively combat climate change.","Yes. I do. I think it’s really one of the main priorities of the next president because we’re running out of time. Climate change is different than other problems. We have a problem with our infrastructure in this country. If we wait five years to build our infrastructure, it’s a missed opportunity but we haven’t dug ourselves a hole. If we wait another five or 10 years to address climate change, we’ve created a situation that is gonna be exceedingly difficult for us to get out of. I think the candidates running for president should be able to tell the American people is how are they going to get something done on climate? I believe I can. I believe I can get a carbon tax bill passed in my first year of president, put a price on carbon, take all that money and give it back to the American people in a dividend. I introduced that proposal in the Congress of the United States and it was bipartisan. I believe in my first year as president, I can get that passed with all the Democrats and with the Republicans who live in coastal states. Their citizens and their constituents are demanding they do something on climate. That will slow climate change down. It won’t stop it. To stop it, we fundamentally need innovation, which is why I’m calling for a fivefold increase in the Department of Energy research budget because we need to innovate new storage technologies, new energy transmission technologies. I’m calling for basically a moonshot around innovation and the best way to do that is by increasing the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold. I’m also calling for us to create a market for something called negative emissions technologies, or direct air capture technologies. These are machines that actually currently exist and they take carbon out of the atmosphere. The problem is, they’re not in scale and they’re way too expensive. They cost like $600 a metric ton and the social cost of carbon is like, $50 to a hundred dollars. But that’s a problem that the private sector can solve. We just have to create a market for them like we did with wind and solar who used to be way too expensive, and the prices have come down because we’ve created a market and the great American innovation economy got behind it. I’m calling for us to take the $5 billion of tax credits that we give fossil fuel companies and use that money to have the government basically purchase carbon from companies that actually create these technologies in an auction type approach, which will lead to the cost of these technologies coming down, and I believe these technologies can take 20 percent of the carbon in our atmosphere out of the atmosphere and not only get us to net zero in our country, which we need to be at 2050, but these technologies can actually save the world. If the United States of America really invents them and owns them, they’ll be the most valuable technologies in the world. I believe I have a real plan to deal with climate change. It’s actionable, and it’s very consistent with the way the American people have solved problems historically.","I think it’s important for us in this country, as well as leaders in the world to take the bold, aggressive action that we need to address the climate crisis that’s before us. The United States alone can’t accomplish this.","I think the next president must take on the issue of global climate change like the humanitarian urgency that it is. It is the greatest threat to humanity that exists. And so I think global climate change should be a moon shot for this generation. To say we are going to have a green economy in the next 10 years. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard. And pass a Green New Deal. Put a price on carbon, and make sure that we have the vision about how to create a green economy with green jobs, with investments in infrastructure, and clean air and clean water as a right.","I think that there’s no question that the next president has within her capacity the ability to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to help encourage human behaviors that are not contributing to climate change. We have seen that where there has been leadership on this issue that we can see results. And this has got to be something where there is leadership at the top that reflects the priorities of people across the country. I speak with farmers, I speak with people who are successful in business, I speak with students, I speak with grandparents and parents. Everyone knows that this is a real issue. And the fact that we have supposed leadership who is pushing science fiction instead of science fact will be to our collective peril. I do believe the next president of the United States can make this a priority and recognize the urgency of this issue, and the fact that this is an issue that presents an existential threat, frankly, to who we are as a species. And we can deal with it, because in large part it is human behaviors that have put us in the place that we are. And we can correct those behaviors.","Yeah, absolutely. I think the next president is going to be the last person who has a chance to stop climate change when it will still matter. The questions are not just what to do in this country, but how to accelerate adoption of strong actions all around the world, because it’s got to be a global solution.","I believe that if we have a president with a vision for a clean energy economy, we will not only defeat climate change, but we will build a clean energy economy with eight million jobs. I’m the candidate with a plan that says it has to be job number one, and I’m the candidate with a plan to put eight million people to work. And as a governor I’ve seen our ability to do this in Washington State where we have the best laws in the country. Yes, not only can we defeat climate change, it is the only option. Victory is the only option against climate change, because without victory there is not survival.","You can’t stop climate change, but you can respond to this crisis in a meaningful way that will reduce greenhouse gases. Right now, this president has done nothing. He is taking us backwards, and I believe that a voice from the heartland is important here because on the coast we know we have rising sea levels. We’ve seen the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, but it’s important to talk about what’s going on right now in the middle of the country. We’ve seen raging wildfires. We’ve seen firefighters die. We’ve seen tornados like we’ve never seen before. We’ve seen hail the size we couldn’t imagine in places spontaneously all over this country. I’ve seen a woman named Fran in Iowa near the Nebraska border who shows me her house submerged in water that she bought with her husband for their two four-year-olds, thought she’d live there forever. So there’s horse hair in the plaster because it’s a century old, and I said to her, “Well, is this water? You built this house or you bought this house right by the river?” She said, “No. The river is two-and-a-half miles away. The water has just never come this far before.” That’s what’s happening in the Midwest. So to me, the argument is, one, we can’t afford not to do anything. What do we do? We get back in the international climate change agreement, immediately. I do that on day one as president. We bring back the clean power rules that are on the cutting room floor. We reduce greenhouse gases by putting the gas mileage standards back in place that President Trump withdrew, and we pass sweeping legislation so we move forward on climate change. It is not happening 100 years from now. The climate crisis is happening now.","We’ve got to address climate change and we’ve got to be aggressive in doing it. I don’t know if one president is going to be able to do it but I think it’s incumbent on us to try. We have got to leave a livable planet for our kids and grandkids and we are not doing that right now. So, is it possible for one person to turn this around? Yes. Is it possible to fix it in the term of one presidency? Probably not, but we can get started in the right direction. REPORTER: So it’s possible to change the trajectory of the issue? MOULTON: Completely possible to change the trajectory of the issue so that we can solve climate change in our lifetimes. But are we going to be able to solve it in a four- or eight-year term? It’s gotten too bad.","I think it is possible for the next president to help lead this country to ensure that we confront climate change before it is too late. No one person nor any one political party will be able to do this on their own, it’s going to take this entire country. Our plan calls for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. It calls for America to be halfway there by 2030, a little more than a decade from where we are right now. Our administration will use executive authority to stop any new oil or gas leases on federal lands, to ensure that every dollar of federal procurement reflects the cost of climate change and pollution. Gives the opportunity to farmers, and those in rural America to lead on this issue as well. For example, paying farmers at a profit to plant cover crops to pull more carbon out of the air, and sequester more of it in the soil. If every single one of us, and every single part of the country does our part, then we can also take our rightful role on the world stage as the indispensable nation, convene the other powers of the planet to do their part as well, and halt the warming of this planet before it becomes so great that the droughts, the floods, the fires and the storms that we see today will pale in comparison for the generations that follow. We have 10 years within which to act, and I want to make sure that I do my part to make every single second count for as much as we can, to ensure that we do all that is possible while time still remains.","I do. Yes. We have to marshal every aspect of our society, our government, our free enterprise system, our educational institutions, our venture capital. All has to be pointing in the direction of reversing climate change. I think if we do it right, if we engage the free enterprise system, if we align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives, that we can actually do it a lot quicker than most people think.","Not alone, and not, certainly, just by doing what has to be done in the United States. Climate change by definition is a global crisis. And instead of having somebody in the White House who refuses to even acknowledge the reality of the problem, we need a president who is going to reach out to every country on earth and make it clear that this is a global issue and we have got to go forward together. My dream, and I don’t know that I can bring this around, but my dream is to convince countries around the world and instead of spending in total one and a half trillion dollars a year on weapons of destruction, that maybe we stand together against the common enemy and we invest in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel into sustainable energy and energy efficiency. So, this is a global problem, we need the whole world working together on it. And as president I would hope to provide that leadership.","It is possible for the next president to reverse the devastating effects that climate chaos has caused in our country. First and foremost, I would host, in the United States, a climate summit. The Paris Agreement will have expired, as far as our ability to get into it, but I would host, in the U.S., a summit, put us back into it and then invest in greening the grid. Solar, wind, fusion, alternative fuel cells, and storage.","I think it’s possible for the next president to make huge advances on climate change. Partly it’s about the United States’ leadership. We lead. We’re just leading in the wrong direction right now. By pulling out of the Paris climate accord, it’s not only what we’re doing here in the United States, we’re giving cover all around the world to any country that says “you know, I don’t really want to spend the money to have to make these changes so that we can help reverse climate change and reverse the negative effects of CO2 in the atmosphere.” I believe that the opportunities for the next president are enormous. We can show worldwide leadership. We can make changes right here at home with the Environmental Protection Agency and other initiatives from the government, we can change the laws. We can make a major investment in infrastructure, clean infrastructure, but also hardened infrastructure against the climate change that’s coming. There’s a lot we can do, and it not only will help us promote a cleaner America and a cleaner world, but also the kinds of investments that will help us build a more prosperous economy. So this one can be a win, win, win. We just got to start. We’ve got to have the leadership for it.","Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our generation. We have 12 years, according to most scientists, we have 12 years. If we do not act in very fundamental and very significant ways, we will cause irreparable harm to our ecosystem. So the next president of the United States needs to be someone who understands that, and who gives it the priority that it needs to have as this kind of an emergency, this kind of an urgency, not only for this country, but for the planet. We need a world-class environmentalist at the head of the E.P.A. We need the E.P.A. to be a magnet for world-class environmentalists, then sustainability experts who know that the president has their back, the full power of the executive branch of the U.S. government is at your back guys. No more apologists for the fossil fuel companies, no more leaders from the chemical companies, or oil companies in the E.P.A. We need, whether it has to do with carbon sequestration, whether it has to do with reforestation, sustainability in terms of energy, and sustainability in terms of transportation, and also a factory farming, nitrous oxide, the methane that, that brings forth. Yeah, we have a president who can absolutely ... We need a president who absolutely can cause a real shift in this situation, and I believe that with the right leadership, the American people are ready to go along.","The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded human history. Climate change is just now accelerating and scientists’ projections are unfortunately getting more and more dismal in terms of the impact of climate change that we’re already seeing in these floods and extreme weather patterns and wildfires and other phenomena here in the U.S. that have already caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage and cost many lives. So climate change is now, to me, one of the most existential threats that we face as a country. The brutal truth is that the United States of America only accounts for about 15 percent of global emissions. So even if we were to go very aggressively towards a much more renewable energy infrastructure, it would likely only slow the rate of climate change incrementally. We need to rejoin the Paris accords, implement a carbon fee and dividend, try and capture carbon and sequester it in various ways, plant millions of trees, but also prepare for the fact that climate change is likely going to be with us and is going to accelerate in the years to come. So we should be investing in ways to mitigate the worst effects including billions of dollars in renewable infrastructure, a dividend of a $1,000 a month for every American adult would make our population more resilient, more able to deal with the worst effects of climate change because when there’s a natural disaster we know it’s the poor that get hit hardest. REPORTER: Sounds like you don’t think the president can stop climate change, but that they can take steps towards combating the effects? YANG: I don’t believe that the president can put a halt to climate change, given that the United States only accounts for 15 percent of global emissions, but we can take dramatic steps to combat it, slow the progress, and mitigate the effects on our own people."
4,4,Do you think Israel meets international standards of human rights?,"Yes. I mean, I think Israel, I’ve said before, and I believe this, Israel is the one essential country on the planet. I say that because of my family history during the Holocaust and that doesn’t mean that Israel’s perfect. Where we have disagreements, we should be able to articulate those disagreements, and I do articulate the disagreements that I’ve had with Benjamin Netanyahu over the years.","I believe in the state of Israel, and I think Israel is not only a crucial ally, they’re the one true democracy in the Middle East, and they do respect the rights of all people. There’s always more work to be done. I’d like to see a two-state solution. I think that’s the best way to move forward for peace and Human Rights for Israel and for the Palestinian people. I think there’s a lot of work to be done. But it begins with a strong commitment to Israel. And as a New Yorker, where the ties to Israel are so strong, I’ve been to Israel four times, I’ve spent a lot of time seeing the threats that Israel faces. I firmly believe that we have to defend the state of Israel, and we have to fight against the movements that would undercut Israel, like BDS. But at the same time, I believe the current Israeli Government has made a lot of mistakes that have hindered the peace process and I believe in a two-state solution. I think that’s where America should put its energy. That’s the best way to address, both, peace and human rights concerns for Israelis and Palestinians.","I think we have a problem right now in America with the way we are debating issues surrounding Israel and Israel’s security. We have a president that seems to not to support this idea of a two-state solution, which has had bipartisan commitment and conviction over decades in our past. My commitment right now is for affirming Israel’s right to exist, affirming Israel’s right to defend itself against enemies which they have virtually surrounding them, but also to affirm the dignity and self-determination of Palestinian people. I believe that we can get back to kind of policies that affirm that two-state solution, affirm human rights, and that America can be a force to accomplishing that in Israel.","I think that Israel’s a trusted partner, a trusted friend to our country and will continue to. I think that there have been certainly in the territories, there have been challenges with the decisions that currently Netanyahu has made. But I also believe that here’s a place where we need to step back and turn around and say we could get things back on track, work with our allies and get to a two-state solution.","I think Israel’s human rights record is problematic and moving in the wrong direction under the current right-wing government. Look, the U.S. can be committed to Israeli security, and to the U.S.-Israel alliance, while also guiding our ally in a direction that leads toward peace. I’m very worried, especially with some of the latest talk about annexation of the West Bank, that their government is moving away from peace in a way that is damaging in the long run to Israeli and Palestinian, and for that matter, American interests.","I believe that Israel, like a lot of other countries, wants to do the right thing, that they can get better. I do believe that we need to recognize and respect the human rights of Palestinians. I agree with former Secretary of State John Kerry that Israel has to choose. It’s going to be a Jewish state or a democratic state. That’s why I believe that a two-state solution is the best solution for Israel. I recognize that that has been made harder over the years through the increase in settlements. My hope is that in the upcoming elections, the Israeli people will send a stronger message about the need for a two-state solution.","I think Israel does meet international standards of human rights. I think Israel’s in a very difficult situation when they’re surrounded by countries who are effectively threatening their existence and don’t believe they have a right to exist. So I think that puts them in an exceedingly difficult situation, in many respects. I think it is always in the best interest of Israel to make sure their response to people who are threatening them is as measured and appropriate as possible, but in terms of your direct question, I think the answer is I do think they meet human rights standards, absolutely.","I think that there are some challenges with Israel that need to be addressed. REPORTER: Could you expand on that? GABBARD: I think that ongoing issues that we continue to see in the conflict between Israel and Palestine are complicated, but there needs to be progress made ultimately to make sure that both the Israeli people and the Palestinian people are able to live in peace and securely.","I do. And I believe that Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East, but we also have to care about her neighbors and make sure that we address humanitarian crises throughout communities including those where the Palestinians live right now. I think we have to do far more to relieve the suffering in places like the West Bank and Gaza. I think it’s important that we continue to provide humanitarian support. But I think what President Trump has done in the Middle East is very damaging. He has done things prematurely outside of a long-term negotiation for a two-state solution, and I think that’s created enormous problems and issues for long-term stability.","I think that Israel as a country is dedicated to being a democracy, and is one of our closest friends in that region, and that we should understand the shared values and priorities that we have as a democracy, and conduct foreign policy in a way that is consistent with understanding the alignment between the American people and the people of Israel. REPORTER: Does Israel meet human rights standards to your personal satisfaction? HARRIS: Well, talk in more detail, what specifically are you referring to? REPORTER: As a country overall in terms of how they? HARRIS: Overall, yes.","When you’re addressing the issues around Israel, one has to look at their evolution. For me, they are at a point now where they are at a crossroads and really have to push towards, how are they going to get to that two-state solution, which pretty much almost every Israeli I know believes in. And I think most Americans support that. But the magic is, how are they going to get from here to there? REPORTER: But in terms of Israel’s behavior as a country, do you think they meet your personal standards of how a country ought to behave in terms of human rights? HICKENLOOPER: Again, there are instances where you can find in almost every country, places where there’s disagreement of how they treat people or how they resolve internal conflicts. I continue to look at Israel as one of our strongest allies. They have been partners with the United States for a long time. Our challenge is to build on that foundation and help them be able to move towards that two-state solution, which again, I think almost every Israeli believes is the ultimate goal.","I’m a longtime supporter of a democratic Israel, and I believe we have to have a two-state solution, and I would work with all parties to make sure that we have that, of justice for people in Palestine, and democracy in Israel. And that depends on a two-state solution, and I would work with everyone to achieve that. REPORTER: And what about whether Israel meets international standards of human rights? INSLEE: I think that all countries can improve in all respects. Certainly our ability to foster a future for the Palestinian people needs all of us to up our game. I do not believe the present government of Israel has followed policies. If those policies can improve to encourage the ability and maintain the access of the future to a two-state solution. And we all need to be dedicated to that.","Yes. I think Israel, however, under Prime Minister Netanyahu has been doing things that are not helpful to bringing peace to the Middle East. The way that he came out in favor of annexing the Golan Heights, what he has done when it comes to the settlements, the fact that we’re not engaging in serious discussions for a two-state solution, our country and the Palestinians, and the Israelis. I think that this is setting us back. And so what I would do is to reach out to restart those negotiations again. I think that President Trump has politicized this issue and has not helped in terms of American support for Israel. Israel is our beacon of democracy in the Mid East. We have a role to play here that is very important. It shouldn’t be politicized the way the Trump Administration has politicized it. And when Israel does things that I think are against public policy and international policy, I will call them out on it, and I will work with them, but, again, I think the way President Trump has done this has made it harder and harder for people to support Israel. You’re seeing a lot of young people that have fallen away from supporting this beacon of democracy in the Mid East, and I think that needs to change.","I think Israel often does but not always. And it’s incumbent on us, as an ally, to hold them accountable. And I’ve done that in Congress. I’ve signed legislation that’s sometimes controversial, to say that we will not supply Israel with weapons and goods if they do not uphold standards for the treatment of Palestinian kids in prison, for example. Now, it’s not that hard for them to do this, and Israel is our most important ally in the Middle East. They are a democracy that we have sworn to protect, and we should. But we also have to hold our friends and allies to the same standards that we should uphold ourselves.","I know that Israel attempts to meet international standards of human rights. I know that they could do a better job. And that’s not just my opinion, that’s from listening to people in Israel say that about their own country. I think we have a role to play to ensure the safety, the human rights, and the dignity of the people of Israel, as well as the people of what will become the state for the Palestinians, right now the Palestinian Authority. We cannot compel or force a two-state solution, but it should be our diplomatic goal. And every resource that we invest, every diplomatic effort should be towards that end. That’s the best way in the long term to guarantee the peace, the stability and the human rights of all people in that region.","You know, I think it’s a very complicated relationship that Israel obviously has with Hamas, dealings with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. I think the United States needs to play a much bigger role in trying to resolve that problem. I think the president has been very disengaged. We need to be a neutral broker but recognizing the importance of Israel and the relationship we have with them for all of the other relationships we have in that region. Well, I think they could do a better job. We need to all participate in the discussion. The United States needs to maintain, in some level, its ability to broker these peace agreements. The problem today is we’re not really even trying.","I have great concerns about the role that Netanyahu is playing in Israel and their relationship with the Palestinians. As I’ve said many times, I believe 100 percent in the right for Israel not only to exist but to exist in peace and security. But the role of the United States is to work with all of the entities in the region including the Palestinians. And to do that in an even-handed way.","Israel is a country that needs to work with the Palestinian people to find a two-state solution. I support putting the U.S. back into the UN Commission on Human Rights. I support increasing aid to the Palestinian people, and I’m going to fire Jared Kushner on Day 1 because he has no business being on the job of seeking a two-state solution or finding peace in the Middle East. It requires serious scholars and a serious leader committed to making it happen. That’s what I’m going to do on Day 1 on that issue. REPORTER: Within the larger issue of the two-state solution, are you personally satisfied that Israel meets human rights standards? SWALWELL: I would like to see Israel not conduct any further settlements into the West Bank. I don’t oppose any geographical changes in either region, Israel or Palestinian area, until we have a two-state solution. And so I’d press both sides: the Palestinians to sort out who speaks for them, whether it’s the PA or Hamas, and for the Israelis to negotiate and have a partner on the other side to seek that two-state solution. But I’m more interested in the future, I’m not going to go back into the past because the future depends on a stable and secure Middle East.","I think that Israel is in a really tough neighborhood. I understand that. They face enormous challenges, and they are our strong ally. We need a liberal democracy in that region and to work with that liberal democracy. But it is also the case that we need to encourage our ally the way we would any good friend to come to the table with the Palestinians and to work toward a permanent solution. I strongly support a two-state solution, and I believe that a good friend says to the Palestinians and to the Israelis, “Come to the table and negotiate.” The United States cannot dictate the terms of a long-term settlement with the Palestinians and the Israelis. But what it can do is urge both of them to go there and to stay out of the way, to let them negotiate the pieces that are most important to them for a lasting peace. The current situation is not tenable. It may be tenable for a week. It may be tenable for a month, but it is not in the long-term interest of either the Israelis or the Palestinians to continue on the path they’re on. They need to come to a two-state solution.","I think that there are many countries, including the United States, that behave in ways that do not always meet international standards of human rights. As President of the United States, I would have an equally robust commitment to both the legitimate security concerns of Israel, and the human rights of the Palestinians, and the economic hopes and opportunities and dignity of the Palestinian people.","Israel is a very, very important ally of the U.S. Certainly, some of the actions that are being taken there are deeply problematic and run afoul of some of the standards we’d like to see countries meet. I’d be hesitant to say that they are in violation of those standards."
5,5,"Who is your hero, and why?","I’d say that my mom and my grandparents. They were Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust in and around Warsaw, and then after the war was over, they spent two years in Poland, then went to Stockholm for a year, then went to Mexico City for a year. They came here to New York to rebuild their shattered lives in the only country that they thought they could. And I’ve spent a lot of time traveling around my state. There are a lot of people with very heavy accents, but none has a heavier accent than my grandparents had, and I don’t know any greater patriots than they were. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? BENNET: Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln faced longer odds than any president of the United States ever has, and that we ever will — which is good news, because there’s a tendency to think that we live in a really dark time, and in some ways we do, but it’s nothing compared to what Abraham Lincoln and people like Frederick Douglass faced. Frederick Douglass, born a slave in the United States of America, fought to end slavery in his lifetime. Those guys were remarkable leaders at a remarkable time in American history, and I just think that their example is one that we need today.","My hero is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I think there’s no president who has done more, over the whole host of the years of this country, there’s no president who’s done more for working people, and who changed the society to actually favor everyday Americans, not just those who had done really well. I grew up in a family where we would have family gatherings, and I always say they talked about Franklin Roosevelt so often, you felt like there was another chair at the table. Because he meant so much to my family in all the ways that he addressed the Depression and the suffering the people were going through. They felt like the president of the United States was on their side and the federal government was on their side, and we need that again. So I look to him as an example of what was and what could be again.","Gosh, my greatest heroes are my parents. I had a family that modeled for me. I think James Baldwin said it best: “Children are never good at listening to their elders, but they never fail to imitate them.” My parents, who had jobs, who were entrepreneurs, but perhaps the biggest thing that stood out to me as a child is that they always were about service — from the stories of my parents’ activism in the civil rights movement sit-ins, to all the way to me witnessing them working on everything from fair housing, to even in retirement my mom ran an organization that dealt with homeless issues and united families. And so, service was a core value in my life because it was what was exhibited to me by my parents and my grandparents, who are truly my heroes. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? BOOKER: You know, the biggest political heroes I have are actually in my community. People that were never elected to office, but shaped the politics of our town. And so, the first person that pops into my mind when you talk about a political hero is a person who was a tenant president of the high-rise projects I lived in in Newark for about eight years, a woman named Miss Virginia Jones, who — she was very political and knew that if you fight within the political system, you can actually make lives better for people in your community. She’s actually the person that told me that I was going to run for city council, even when I kind of resisted that. So, she modeled for me a politics that’s about service and leadership that understands that you can’t lead the people if you don’t love the people.","My hero is, candidly, my wife. We’ve been together about 20 years, and we have three young kids: 17, 15 and 12. And both what she’s been able to do in making sure that even after a decade in public life, that our kids know that they’re the most important things in our lives, and being able to support me while having a career. I wouldn’t be here doing this without her. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? BULLOCK: If you look locally, there was a guy named Joe Mazurek who was attorney general when I first got engaged in public service. And Joe has since passed away, but he was someone that, every day he woke up, not about political advantage, but it was like, “What’s best to do?” And he was my mentor along the way. At a greater scale, and maybe it’s because I come from the West, if I look at presidents, well you’ve had incredible presidents over the years. Teddy Roosevelt, both what he did for public lands, what he did to make sure that everybody felt like government was about individuals, it wasn’t about the big companies. And his boldness along the way, probably from a presidential perspective.","Politically, I would go with Lincoln, because he not only held the country together, but also had a vision for the future: Laid the groundwork for the Transcontinental Railroad, set up the National Science Foundation, all while part of the country had gone to war against the other part. And it shows that you need to have vision, even or especially during existential crises. In addition to all the reasons why we already know Lincoln was great.","My mom. My mom is probably the biggest reason that I went into public service in the first place. When she was young she was a part of the old Chicano movement, the Mexican-American civil rights movement. She never held office but she ran for office for city council once when she was 23. She lost, but she stayed very active trying to push forward for women’s empowerment and Hispanic empowerment. And I grew up with that. So I grew up with my mother as a role model, believing that democratic participation was a good thing. REPORTER: This might be the same answer, but do you have a political hero? CASTRO: Cesar Chavez. I grew up reading a lot about Cesar Chavez and the farm workers movement, being inspired by his activism and the activism of Dolores Huerta and many others.","My hero is, in many ways, my wife. I think she’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met, and I feel so blessed to have her in my life, and she just has such a terrific moral compass that she just lifts me up. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? DELANEY: I think everyone has to view Abraham Lincoln as the great political hero of our country. It’s hard to compare anyone to George Washington, of course, but what Lincoln did at an incredibly difficult time in our country’s history, which was to save our nation and move us to a place where we could get past this original sin of slavery. I think it’s hard to think of anyone being more heroic at a more difficult moment in our country’s history than President Lincoln.",I’m inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King and all he did in his life to fight for justice and equality.,"My grandmother is one of my heroes. She is a hero because she is the one who taught me that using your voice is important, and that grassroots activism can make a difference, and what you do with your time actually matters. She was a woman who grew up in upstate New York, very modest means, she never went to college. And she was a secretary in our State Legislature, and she’s the one who recognized that women didn’t have much of a voice in politics 75 years ago, so she asked all the women of the Legislature to participate, and all the women she knew in Albany, and they became the Women’s Democratic Club. And over time, those women became powerful, because you couldn’t get elected in Albany without the blessing of my grandmother and her lady friends, because they did all the work. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? GILLIBRAND: Oh, a political hero. Well, I have several, actually. I just wrote a children's book on the history of suffrage and I was so inspired by Harriet Tubman because she was a woman who was obviously born into slavery, had absolutely no rights. And after she escaped from slavery, instead of just living a free life, she went back into danger over and over and over again to save people. And what I noticed about her was her empathy. She said, “I've heard their cries and sighs, and seen their tears, and I would give every drop of blood in my veins to free them.” So for her it was all about empathy and absorbing the pain that people who were enslaved felt. And she didn't care what danger she went into. She went back over and over. And after slaves were freed, she continued to be an advocate for rights. She became a suffragist and she traveled all across the country speaking out until she was very, very advanced in age. And so she was a fearless person, and I really admired her fearlessness, her courage, her faith, and her empathy.","I would say my first and forever hero was my mother. REPORTER: And do you have a political hero? HARRIS: Shirley Chisholm. I mean certainly now that I’m running for president, and I think about the kind of ground that she broke, you know, her forever words: “Unbossed, unbought,” the fact that she really was a real role model, I think, to so many of us, regardless of race or gender. She just walked up to that microphone, and she took it, and she used her voice in a way that was speaking for so many people who otherwise could not be behind that microphone.","Well, my personal hero, like many people, was my mother, who was widowed twice before she was 40 and raised all four kids by herself with a flinty frugal nature but a deep love. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? HICKENLOOPER: Certainly Abraham Lincoln. I look at how he was able to bring the country together when it was probably even more divided than America is today, and how he was able to, as he said, make his enemies — defeat his enemies by making them his friends.","Well I have two. It’s my wife, Trudy, who I met when I was 15. Actually it’s three, because it’s she, and my mother and father, who were — my dad was a biology teacher, my mom was a retail clerk, and they helped revegetate meadows on the slopes of Mt. Rainier. But, No. 1 is Trudy Inslee. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? INSLEE: The American voter, who I think is going to help us restore democracy this year. And I look forward to helping them in that regard.","My hero has been my mom, and my dad, and for really the reasons that they devoted their lives to helping people. My mom was a teacher. She taught second grade until she was 70 years old. Her favorite unit was a monarch butterfly unit, and she would dress up as a monarch butterfly, with antennas and tights and a tunic, and a sign that said, “To Mexico or bust.” And my dad was a newspaper man his whole life, and really took on the causes of people that wrote in to him in his column, whether it was people that were let down by a bank or got ripped off by something, and he would take it on with humor, but he would help them. And I was so fortunate to have two parents that loved their jobs, and had a zest for life, and really had a zest for public service. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? KLOBUCHAR: My political hero would be Walter Mondale, who has been my mentor forever, since I first started in his office when he was vice president and I was an intern. And I thought I was going to do all these glamorous policy papers, but instead they assigned me to do the furniture inventory and crawl under every desk and lamp and write the serial numbers down. I learned two things. One: He was an honest man; nothing was missing. And two: Always do good, no matter what your first job is in politics. Because that was my first government job in Washington, and a U.S. senator was my second.","My wife right now. She’s an amazing partner, and the way that she has supported me in making this decision, and supported me in doing this run, even though we have a 6-month-old at home, is pretty incredible. And it certainly sets a good example for me. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? MOULTON: A political hero? Look, I mean, I look up to a lot of people. I love the way that John F. Kennedy inspired people to think about what they could do for the country, not just for themselves. Not just about what America can do for you, but you can do for the country. And I think that gets to the core of what America is all about — that we are a country that’s based on service, about striving to be better than we are.","My family; my kids; my wife, Amy; my folks are my heroes — the strongest people I’ve ever known, the most giving and courageous people I’ll ever meet. And, so, they’re my role models, my inspiration and my reason for doing this. REPORTER: And do you have a political hero? O’ROURKE: Abraham Lincoln is my political hero. He faced the toughest test this country has ever seen and brought us through.","Wow, I mean right now it’s Baker Mayfield, the quarterback of the Cleveland Browns. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? RYAN: I would say President Kennedy, probably. I grew up, I went to John F. Kennedy High School, and we kind of organized the school around him. And I think that had a big influence on me as far as public service, and that was tied to being Catholic and really aspirational and social-gospel-oriented view of the world. So I carry that with me.","I have many heroes and heroines. I would say Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is somebody who has inspired my life and my work. Not only because of his incredible leadership qualities, but the depth of his analysis and his courage in taking on a hateful establishment. And I admire him very much.","My hero I get to serve with in the U.S. Congress is John Lewis, for what he did during the civil rights movement, but also what he’s done on the issue of gun violence. He led us to the well a couple years ago after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and told us if we’re willing to cause a little bit of good trouble, that we can make a difference on the issue. So we had a sit-in for over 27 hours. He’s already done enough for our country, and he still does more and more every day, so he inspires me.","Oh, Teddy Roosevelt. REPORTER: And why? WARREN: Because Teddy Roosevelt took on the powerful. He was a trust-buster, and he did it not only to save our economy, but he also did it to save our democracy. And it worked. Now, we’ve gone up and down since then. But the idea of somebody who just stands up and says, “I’m going to fight for what’s right. I’m going to run up that hill, and I’m going to get as many people as I can to run along with me, and I’m going to make the kind of change we need to make in this country.” That’s my guy.","I suppose that my hero would be my father. Although, in another way, my mother, but really more my father. My father was a kind of magical character. He was like a cross between William Kunstler and Zorba the Greek. My father, when I came home from the seventh grade, and I said that our social studies teacher had said that if we do not fight in Vietnam, we will be fighting on the shores of Hawaii — and for those of you who are too young to remember, there was this thing called the Domino Theory that was used to sell the American people on the idea of the Vietnam War, that if we didn’t stop the communists there, that all these other countries would fall like dominoes — So when I said that, when I said that at the dinner table, that that’s what the teacher had told us, my father jumped up, and he said to my mother, “Sweetheart, get the visas, we’re going to Vietnam.” This was 1965. And my parents traipsed three kids, and we all went to Saigon, because my father wanted us to know what war is, so that, in his words, “The military industrial complex would never eat his children’s brains.” That’s who my father was. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? WILLIAMSON: My political hero would be Bobby Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Bobby Kennedy is a political hero of mine, I think because in my lifetime, when I was very young — and this was true for my generation — there were in people like Bobby Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, even though we were children, they held aloft the highest philosophical visions within a political context. They talked about the great ideas of what it meant to live on this earth as brothers, and how this could be contextualized and manifest in society. It touched me deeply then and it touches me now. FDR is ... first of all, we can talk about any political hero and say, “Well, they did some things wrong as well.” So when I say that FDR is a bit of a political hero of mine, that’s not to say I don’t realize some big mistakes that he made as well. And certainly if you talk about someone like Thomas Jefferson, I mean on one hand you’re talking about the man who wrote the Declaration of Independence, and as he himself said, “Every institution is but a shadow cast by its founder.” And he himself owned slaves. So when you look at great political figures in our history, what you admire and what you are grateful for are the principles that they bequeathed to us. That does not mean that they themselves, on a historical level in terms of their own personhood, always embodied even the principles that they themselves purported to stand for. So those principles of course are what I recognize as the genius of the mind of Jefferson. Abraham Lincoln, not only the brilliance of Lincoln, but the personal courage of Lincoln. I’m fascinated by both Roosevelt and Eisenhower and their leadership during World War II. Because what occurs to me about both of them is how sober — deeply intellectually, emotionally and psychologically sober — they were. You know, when you look at the Vietnam War and you look at Iraq war, just the recklessness, the irresponsibility, the lack of deep, deep emotional sobriety. You didn’t see that with Eisenhower or with Roosevelt. These were very, very, very serious men, both of whom hated war. And the thing about Eisenhower also — and this is often true of generals, because I’ve seen it — they’re not these reckless little boys playing with war like it’s a Lego set. So when you read about people in history who did such extraordinary things, but were themselves just human beings ... they weren’t people who didn’t have problems. They weren’t people who didn’t have issues. But they did what they needed to do. And our generation so needs to see that right now. A crisis is never convenient for a country or for an individual. But when you rise to the occasion, extraordinary things do happen.","My hero are my parents because of all the sacrifices they made for me and my brother after they came to this country as immigrants in the ‘60s. They actually didn’t come together. They met in graduate school. Well, they met, then got married and had me and my brother. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? YANG: So I am the godfather of Teddy Roosevelt’s great-great-granddaughter — so think about that for a moment — but I’m a big fan of Teddy Roosevelt because of his leadership during a tough time for the country."
6,6,Would there be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of your first term?,"No. REPORTER: Do you want to elaborate at all? BENNET: If we’re there for another couple of years in Afghanistan, we’ll have been there for 20 years. If you’re a kid in college or you’re 18 or 19 years old, you’ve only known us being at war. We’ve spent $5.6 trillion in the Middle East. It’s time for us to come home from Afghanistan.","Well I have spent a lot of time with families who lost their loved ones in Afghanistan and it is a war that has gone on too long. We have to make sure there is a peace settlement in Afghanistan; it obviously has to involve the Taliban. Until that point, I don’t think it’s sensible to take out our troops. But we hope for the day where there’s some kind of peace that at least allows us to have much less of a presence in Afghanistan, maybe even one day to remove all of our troops. REPORTER: That sounds like a “yes, if it’s feasible” but you don’t really think it’s feasible. DE BLASIO: You want me to do that? REPORTER: Yeah I want a yes or no. DE BLASIO: No, I’m saying …. Some things, my friend, I think you would agree, are not always a yes or a no. REPORTER: Right but we want them to be. DE BLASIO: But they aren’t. I would say so ... yes, if it’s possible to forge a real peace plan in Afghanistan that’s durable, the ideal, of course, would be to remove all U.S. troops. But even if we could get a more stable situation that would allow for fewer troops to be there, that would be a huge step forward.","No, we need to bring our American troops home. We cannot have forever wars in this nation, and this is one area where I’m going to be determined to bring American troops home. But I think it’s a mistake in presidential campaigns to start putting out timelines for our military. I think there’s a lot of irresponsibility in that, when you need to negotiate our troops coming home under the right terms and right circumstances, and not in a way that’s going to mandate future interventions in the future. So, my driving force will be to bring our troops home safe and sound, under the conditions that will lead toward peace and security in that region. This is not something that I take lightly, when you have American troops on the front lines, at risk. We’ve seen military individuals and their families making incredible sacrifices for this country. I’ll bring those troops home and I’ll do it the right way.","You know, we’ve been 18, 19 years in Afghanistan now. Think about somebody joining the military right now — Afghanistan and the conflict has been going on for their entire life. Even as governor, I went over to Afghanistan in 2013. And talking to both military leaders and in the diplomatic corps, the discussion was: It’s time to get out, it’s time to let this country go forward. I think what we ultimately need to do is not only remove the troops, but if we’re gutting our diplomatic efforts as this administration has been putting less in the State Department, it’s going to be that much harder for stability.","No. Maybe whatever is needed to prevent attacks on the homeland, as we do around the world through the right kind of special operations and intelligence presence. But you’re not going to see what we have today. When I left Afghanistan in 2014, I thought I was one of the last people turning out the lights. Five years later, we’re still there. And you can now be old enough to be deployed to Afghanistan, and not even have been alive on 9/11. We’ve got to put an end to endless war globally. And when it comes to Afghanistan, one thing that everybody can agree on is that we’re getting out. The hard part is figuring out whether we can get out well, or whether we’re going to get out poorly. And one of my top priorities is to make sure our departure goes well for America, if this administration fails to bring that conflict to a close.","No. I recognize, like a lot of people, that we do need to withdraw from our engagements there. The question is how we do that. I disagree with this administration’s haphazard way of announcing and going about withdrawal. We need to withdraw in a way that is orderly, that respects our allies, that leaves the region as stable as we possibly can, given the circumstances.","I’m like most Americans, I want to get our troops out of Afghanistan, I want to get our troops out of Syria, I want to get our troops out of Iraq. But I want to do it when we’ve accomplished, effectively, the goals that are in the best interest of the American people. As it relates to Afghanistan, I would like to get our troops out of Afghanistan, except for a very small contingent of American troops who would be left there to, effectively, train security forces. That’s really what I would view as a successful goal for troop withdrawal out of Afghanistan at this point. REPORTER: So yes, but very minimally? DELANEY: Very minimal. I would basically provide the same answer for Iraq and Syria. I think the goals are a little different. In Syria, we have to make sure our allies, the Kurds, are somehow taken care of, that they’re settled in a region, probably not on the Turkish border. We have to make sure Iran doesn’t have a presence on the Israeli border. We have to make sure that ISIS is actually fully defeated. So our goals there are a little different. Our goals with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan, I think, are to ensure that there’s not terrorism. At the end of the day, the reason we’re in all these countries, fundamentally, was about the fact that we thought there was a terror risk to the United States of America and our citizens. We went there for those reasons, and I wouldn’t want to leave until I felt like that risk didn’t exist. I think realistically, with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan, we should expect there to be very significant troop withdrawal from those two countries. But we should also realistically acknowledge that it’s in our self-interest as a country to keep a small presence there to training local security and law enforcement in those countries to make sure they’re doing the things they need to do to combat terror, because that’s in our self-interest.","There will not be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of my first term. REPORTER: Could you expand on that? Just why? GABBARD: Our country has been at war in Afghanistan for far too long, creating a great cost to our troops and to the American people, leaving us and the Afghan people no better off than we were before. First of all, I’m a soldier, I’ve served over 16 years in the Army National Guard, in Congress over six years on both the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees. I’ve deployed twice to the Middle East and I know firsthand the cost of war. We’ve got to take on the threats to our national security, threats like Al Qaeda and ISIS, and defeat those threats. And as president, I will end the wasteful regime-change wars that have taken such a toll on our troops and on the American people, with the trillions of dollars that we’ve spent on these wars. Dollars that we need to invest in things like health care, infrastructure, education and so much more.","I believe that we need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. I think if we want to have long-term troop engagements in those countries, we need to have a new A.U.M.F., an authorization for use of military force. The ones that we passed immediately after 9/11, I don’t believe — are no longer appropriate for what we are doing across the Middle East. I think the troops particularly in Syria should be drawn down. I don’t think we have true authorization for combat operations there, and I believe that if we are going to engage in anti-terrorism, it should be far more targeted. If we need to engage in stability operations, that should be something that Congress, again, opines on, and authorizes military force.","I believe we should bring back our troops from Afghanistan, but I also believe that we need to have a presence there in terms of supporting what the leaders of Afghanistan want to do in terms of having peace in that region, and certainly suppressing any possibility of ISIS or any other terrorist organization from gaining any steam. REPORTER: So maybe a small presence? HARRIS: I think the question is the type of presence, right? And as we have done in the past, I think that it is completely appropriate that we would give support to the Afghan government in terms of helping them train their troops and thinking about how we can provide assistance so that they can have their own people up and running in a way that they keep their country secure, and in particular, prevent it from becoming a haven, or returning to being a haven, for terrorists who ultimately could obviously attack our country.","If there were troops there, there’d be very few. I think that as we go forward, we need to look around the world and perhaps put a sharper focus on what are the benefits we get from our military deployments. But Afghanistan might still have some troops in it.","Not in any sizable number. We have to change our foreign policy to stop this mirage that we can rebuild whole countries and cultures. If we do have any remaining forces, it would be Special Forces to protect against terrorist activities. But it is time to do what I’ve said when I was against the Iraq war. I now believe we should bring our troops home from Afghanistan, and we should speak up very vocally against what Donald Trump and John Bolton are trying to do, which is to set the stage for another war in Iran, just like they did in the war against Iraq. We need to stop that today.","No. I think we need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We have been there longer than some of our young people have been on this earth, and it is time to work with the government there and, again, with our allies -- we don’t want to do this alone — to make sure that the government remains there strong. But it is time to bring our troops home.","If there were, they’d be there with a clear mission to prevent terror attacks and that’s it. I’m sorry, but we’ve got to abandon nation-building in Afghanistan, it just hasn’t worked. And we’ve got to be cleareyed about what the troops are there to do. We also can’t just withdraw them so quickly, without a plan, that they have to go back. Because that’s the mistake we made with Iraq, is that we withdrew the troops so quickly that we had to send them back. I want to bring the troops home from the Middle East more than anyone, having spent so much time there myself, but I want to make sure they can come home for good and not have to go back on my watch.","There would not. We need to end the wars that began, in the case of Afghanistan, nearly 18 years ago. In the case of Iraq, nearly 28 years ago. Bring these service members back to their home country, to their communities, support them as they transition into civilian life. We have to decide that we will not achieve our foreign policy goals on the backs of 18- and 19- and 20-year-old service members who are deployed in dozens of countries, half a world away right now. We have to begin to bring these wars to a close, and address legitimate foreign policy concerns and goals through our diplomacy, and through working with other countries in the region.","Well, I’d have to look at the circumstances, but it’d probably be very limited. I do worry about leaving these safe-havens for terrorists to plot attacks, and I think we do have to have, at least with an international coalition, be a part of making sure that these attacks can’t be planned in some of these safe-havens. We just saw in Sri Lanka the other day, there are still people in the world who want to do bad things. I don’t think — you know, I was against the war in Iraq — don’t think we need to have a huge presence, but we do need to recognize that we have some responsibility to prevent things from happening in our own country.","I suspect not. I think that we would work as aggressively as we can with our allies in the region to end the endless wars that we have been participating in. I fear very much, and doing everything I can to get the United States now out of the horrific war in Yemen, and to do everything I can to make sure that Trump doesn’t get us into a war with Iran. So to answer your question, I think by the end of my first term, our troops would be home.","I will seek to pull out American troops from Afghanistan who are not there to train and equip or provide security at our embassy, but I do think we need to reduce the presence. I think Congress needs to vote on a new use of military force. That’s Congress’s role, to define what I call the three T’s: the time that we’re going to be there; the number of troops we’re going to have on the ground, and whether those troops include only U.S. troops or require allies to be a part of it, too; and the terrain covered, whether the authorization extends only to Afghanistan, or other parts of the globe. We’ve seen Congress unwilling to do that and the president unwilling to ask, and I would ask Congress immediately to redefine our role in Afghanistan. REPORTER: Is it fair to say that your answer is “yes, but very few,” that there would be American troops? SWALWELL: As president, I would significantly reduce the troop level in Afghanistan. We want to protect the embassy we have there. There are still Afghan army forces that we want to train and equip, so they can defend their own country, but I think we should shift largely to supporting them economically so that they can stand themselves up, give their people opportunity, make sure it’s an equal-opportunity country where men and women are able to compete. That’s the best hope for Afghanistan’s future.",No.,"As president of the United States, I would make no move in Afghanistan until first I spoke to Afghan women. I want to hear from the Afghani women. I’m very aware of the history of the Taliban in relationship to women, and so nothing happens until first I talk to them.","My hope would be that there would be no American troops in Afghanistan at the end of my first term, but it’s impossible to know that for sure, given that reality on the ground might lead us to have to have people there if we can accomplish goals in that timeframe."

8,8,Do you think illegal immigration is a major problem in the United States?,I do not think illegal immigration is a major problem in the United States. I do think our broken immigration system is a major problem. I was part of the Gang of Eight in 2013 — four Democrats and four Republicans — who wrote the comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate with 68 votes. I think that still could be the basis of fixing our immigration system.,"I think we have, in this country, an immigration crisis that’s self-created. And we’re going through a national identity crisis that we have to resolve and we can. Look, I represent half a million people who happen to be undocumented. But they’re our neighbors, they work with us in our workplaces. They’re our friends, they’re our fellow human beings. You know, when I’m on the subway or when I’m in the supermarket, I don’t know who’s documented and who’s undocumented. I do know that we should have laws that provide comprehensive immigration reform and allow everyone who’s here now to have a pathway to stay and, you know, follow the right rules that allow them to stay. We have a nation that’s now, in so many ways, set against ourselves. We need people to bring their skills and talents here. We need work to be done all over this country that’s only happening because there are immigrants here to contribute to our economy. But we can’t seem to work it out. And actually, the American people are pretty advanced, in my view, and thinking this through and they want a solution. They think the Dreamers should be allowed to stay, they believe that we should stop punitive policies like family separation and they want a lasting immigration reform. And that’s what I would focus on as president. Really following that American majority that wants to settle this issue, once and for all, and stop this conflict that’s just holding us back. REPORTER: I can’t totally tell if that’s a yes or a no. de BLASIO: I think we have an immigration crisis. I think we can have a system that allows us to make sense of people coming here in a productive way. Right now, we don’t have that.","I think we have challenges with undocumented immigrants in our country. And a lot of those challenges is by forcing them into the shadows, we are creating a less safe environment. The Trump administration policies have made many communities less safe, and I know this having been a former mayor, it’s that right now in the city I used to govern, we have immigrant communities who are afraid to come forward with police, reporting everything from — afraid to report everything from domestic violence to real serious crimes, because we created an atmosphere of fear, which is always a toxic atmosphere. We need to make sure that we create systems that work for our safety and our well-being, that help to expand our economy, that affirm the truth of a lot of people that are in this country, like Dreamers, that they are citizens in every way in our country, except for a piece of paper. And we also need to do the right things that protect our country from illegal drugs coming in, and other challenges. We can affirm our values as a country and have immigration systems that support our economy, that grow our country, and that make sure that we stay secure and strong. And this lie that somehow all of these things are mutually exclusive, that we can’t affirm our values, keep ourselves safe, grow our economy and make sure that people are on pathways to citizenship that are already here — we can do those all, and I’ll be the kind of president that gets that kind of comprehensive immigration reform done.","I think that — at least I, I think even most Democrats believe in border security and keeping families safe, an orderly economy. But you look at southern border as an example, the number of people being apprehended are about a third of what they were even two decades ago. The idea that, O.K., we should just build a wall, sort of that 18th-century solution to a 21st-century problem. So, at the end of the day we should have an orderly immigration system, but all of this folly also just shows how we need to be doing more when it comes to immigration reform and Washington D.C. has been so broken that, they haven’t even taken that first step? REPORTER: But do you think it’s a major problem? BULLOCK: Do I think that illegal — REPORTER: Illegal immigration, yes — BULLOCK: I think that most families are worried about, do they have health care? Are their kids going to do well, better than themselves? Can you afford education? So, there’s a whole host of problems out there. I don’t know, I wouldn’t classify it as bigger than if I’m going to have health care tomorrow.","I think the big problem in the United States is that we lack comprehensive immigration reform. We have over 10 million undocumented immigrants in the country who need a pathway to citizenship. They’re often participating fully in communities, and even as taxpayers, but aren’t able to have full citizenship, and the rights and responsibilities that go with that. Of course, we need things like border security and we need to clean up our lawful immigration process too. The biggest crisis around immigration today is the inhumanity of this administration’s policies. Yeah, our broken immigration system is a problem. One of the things that it leads to is a lot of people of uncertain, or undocumented status in this country with no clear path ahead of them.","Illegal immigration is an issue that this administration has drummed up to cause fear and paranoia. There are a lot of people at the southern border that are coming, requesting asylum. We have a lot of people who are fleeing Central American countries, that are doing so because they can’t find safety and opportunity in their home country. I believe that we need to decriminalize our immigration system and go back to treating it as a civil violation. That we need to change completely how we look at this issue, instead of choosing cruelty, the way that this administration wants us to do. The way that they have separated little children from their families, I believe that we need to choose compassion. We have a border that is probably more secure than it ever has been, with more resources dedicated to it than we ever have. And the people that are coming do not represent a threat to our national security. We need to end detention. We need to make sure that people seeking asylum can make their claim for asylum in an orderly way at our ports of entry. We need to raise the number of refugees that we accept into the United States. And we need to end programs like 287(g), that turn local officials into federal immigration officials. So, I have a completely different view of what we need to do on immigration from what this president does. REPORTER: Is it that you don’t see it as a problem at all or that you just see it as a very different kind of problem then President Trump does? CASTRO: Well, I recognize that we have a challenge on our hands with so many people trying to come into the United States at the southern border. But I believe that there’s a better, stronger solution to it than cruelty and stoking up fear and paranoia and criminalizing these people. Instead, what we need to do is put in place the ability to process these claims. These folks do not represent a threat to our national security. We need to treat them humanely and compassionately. And we have to recognize that we have a secure border right now, and we can make the right investments to things like technology at our ports of entry to make sure that we are able to detect — to catch human trafficking and drug trafficking better than we do today. In the long run, what I believe is that we need a 21st-century Marshall Plan for Central America and Latin America, so that people can find safety and opportunity there, instead of having to come and knock on the door of the United States.","I don’t think it’s a major problem, but I do think we need to fix our broken immigration system. One of the fundamental responsibilities of government is to update the basic institutions in our society based on how the world has changed. And the world has changed a lot and immigration patterns have changed. What’s gone on with our country economically has changed, and we really have an outdated immigration system. So, I don’t think illegal immigration is a problem in our country at this point. What is a problem, is the fact that we have 11 million undocumented residents in our country, many of which are adding a lot of value to our country. And they have a right to — or we should give them the ability to have a path to legal status and hopefully over time, to citizenship. I think that’s in the common interest of the American people.","Our broken immigration system is a major problem in this country. Both with the challenges that we continue to see at the border, as well as the broken legal immigration system. That must be addressed.","Immigration has always been a strength in this country. Our diversity is a strength. And I believe that we need a much better approach towards immigration. We need comprehensive immigration reform, and one of the reasons why I’m running for president is I despise what President Trump is doing at the border. We should never be separating families, children from their parents. We should never be locking people up in inhumane conditions who are seeking our help. So, I would reimagine what we do at the border. I would make sure we have a proper asylum program, have real immigration judges, make sure that we have a system that works for this country. And recognizing that immigration, really, has always been a strength.","I think the major problem for the United States is that we have not, and we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, period. REPORTER: Do you think illegal immigration is a problem at all? HARRIS: I think that there is no question that there is an administration in place right now that has vilified immigrants, that has played on the fear of people and has incited fear. And it is irresponsible. It is the height of irresponsibility, when in the name of supposed border security, that we are separating children from their parents. As far as I’m concerned, that’s a human rights abuse being committed by this administration. We have got to put in place a policy and law that allows the 11 million-plus people who are in this country, who are undocumented — that gives them an opportunity to be on the path to earn and to have status. And right now we have not done that. I also strongly believe that America should keep its promise to our Dreamers and those who receive DACA protection. And we told them that if they gave us information about the circumstances of their arrival and what they are currently doing, we told them that if you pass the vet, if you’ve proven that you’re productive and you’ve not committed any crimes, that you’d receive protection from deportation. This administration came in and broke that promise to these young people and that is a shame. It’s a shame. And it needs to be corrected. We need to keep our promise.","I think illegal immigration is a significant issue. It’s not as much of a problem in a country right now where we have 3.8 percent unemployment. But, that being said, we need a system where everyone plays by the rules. And I think we should overhaul our immigration program and we’re a nation built on immigrants, but we need to look at, where do we need the greatest help? Is it in agricultural immigrant workers? Is it in technology? Right now, our system doesn’t seem to have a rational framework of how it works best. REPORTER: But you don’t — it doesn’t sound like you see it as a crisis or anything like that. HICKENLOOPER: No, no, but I think certainly when I campaigned for reelection in Colorado in 2014, we saw again and again, people who had small businesses, commercial painting businesses, sheetrocking businesses, who wouldn’t pay their workers under the table and they had lost their businesses to people that were paying their workers under the table. And I think that is a significant problem.","I believe that our nation is founded on immigration. We respect and value diversity. I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against the Muslim ban. But yes, we have to have some degree of immigration in a way that’s lawful, and we should do that. And we should protect the Dreamers, as I have done, which is to get education for the Dreamers, and now we need comprehensive immigration reform — this is just to bring these folks into the true mainstream and citizenship in the United States. REPORTER: I can’t totally tell if that was a yes or a no on whether illegal immigration is a major problem. INSLEE: Listen, we want to have a legal system, we want to embrace refugees, like I have done in saying we should have Syrian refugees. I want to help the Dreamers, we want to encourage new streams of talent into America. But yes, we have some laws, and we are not going to allow illegality. We just need to follow the law, including allowing people to have asylum who deserve it and we need a rational way to do that.","I think that we have done nothing about immigration for so long, and we haven’t done enough to figure out a smart way to bring people that are in our country to citizenships — people who are obeying the law, people who have been willing to learn English. What do we need? Well, we need comprehensive immigration reform. The bill that we passed a few years back, to me, is a good formula. It basically gives people the right, as long as they follow the law, to pursue a path to citizenship. It’s economic. Nearly 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed up by immigrants — 25 percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries. We need workers right now in America in our fields, in our farms, in our nursing homes. I make the economic argument for immigration reform, no matter where I am in this country. And once you do that, the nonpartisan budget analysis on this bill was that it would bring the debt down by $158 billion. Everyone should want that. Once you have that money, yes, you can do more when it comes to personnel at the border. You can make sure that we’re smart about how we are handling cases at the border. But the answer is not an $8 billion wall. The answer is comprehensive immigration reform. REPORTER: On that question, it sounds like it’s somewhere between a yes and a no. KLOBUCHAR: Well, we have problems with immigration in this country, but it is a problem really of our own making because we have so many people here that want to part of our economy, and I think we need to have a path to citizenship, and allow them to participate in that economy. And that includes Dreamers, people who came over here by no fault of their own. So undocumented workers, to me, they don’t diminish America. They are America. And I think we have to find a way to make it work. That doesn’t mean that when people commit serious crimes — no matter who they are — that they don’t go to jail. Of course they do, but the key here is to have a system where we have order at the border, but we also have comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship.","Illegal immigration is an issue and Democrats have to admit that it’s something that we have to confront. Republicans have to be honest about the facts: That we need immigrants, that we’re a country of immigrants, that we have got to give a pathway of citizenship to Dreamers and others who are parts of our community and parts of our economy. But the truth of the matter is that there are a lot of Central Americans, in particular, coming to the southern border right now. What we should be doing is addressing that by giving targeted aid to Central America. To make it safe for these people to stay home if that’s where they would like to stay. Of course, Trump is doing the exact opposite. He’s exacerbating the problem. He’s making whatever crisis there is, worse. If you go to the border and you see asylum refugees who can’t get in, if you see kids literally in cages, you recognize that yes, this is a crisis and nobody thinks the system is perfect. So, it’s time for major reforms.","I think that immigration is one of the greatest opportunities for the United States. We just introduced a plan that would ensure that we speed the process by which those who have greencards in this country can become full U.S. citizens, participate to their full potential towards the betterment of this country. We bring millions out of the shadows, beginning with more than one million Dreamers, to ensure that they become U.S. citizens as soon as possible. They’re already contributing so much to the success and the greatness of this country, imagine what they can do as U.S. citizens. And then I want to make sure that we follow our asylum laws, and treat those who are coming to our border, fleeing some of the deadliest countries on the face of the planet, with the humanity that they deserve, that’s in the best interests and traditions of the United States of America. I will put an end to the chaos that Donald Trump has created at our border. Whether it’s the walls that he wants to build that we will not allow to be constructed, or no longer putting kids in cages or reuniting those families who have been separated. This country will begin living our values when it comes to our immigration laws. REPORTER: I can’t totally tell if that’s a yes or no on whether illegal immigration is a major problem. O’ROURKE: Undocumented immigration is an opportunity. It’s an opportunity for us to rewrite our laws that are in accord with our values, with the reality that we see in our communities and with the best interests of this country. We just need leadership that reflects that, and that’s the kind of leadership that I hope to be able to provide.","I think it’s a broken system. I think we need to turn it into an advantage for us. We need a strong border. We need to know who’s coming in and out of our country. I have a district and represent a state that has an opiate crisis. So we want to keep bad people and drugs out of our country, and it’s important for us to do that. We also need to be a compassionate country and accept people who are coming from war-torn areas or countries run by gangs. And we need to parlay the fact that people really want to be in the United States into our economic advantage and lead to growth and entrepreneurship and innovation. We’re losing people who want to start, and have started, billion-dollar companies that couldn’t get the proper paperwork done and stay in the United States. So they’re creating these businesses in Canada or China. And so, we can do both, and that’s the big problem with the debate today is you got to be on one side or the other. We can actually do both: strong borders and a compassionate, economically viable immigration system.","I think it is a problem. It is certainly not the kind of problem that Donald Trump makes it out to be. Trump is a demigogue trying to divide the American people up, and he’s picking on in a disgusting way the undocumented people in this country. So, it’s an issue, and we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need a path toward citizenship for the undocumented. We need to make sure that the 1.8 million young people in the DACA program get immediate legal protection. And we need a humane border policy for those who are seeking asylum.","I think undocumented immigrants need a path to citizenship in the United States. The crisis that I see are, you know, people leaving Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala coming to the U.S., risking everything, going across a hot desert with little food and little shelter and being received at the border. Not with open arms or shelter and, you know, compassion, but being separated, moms from their babies put in detention camps, and no resources to adjudicate the refugee claims. That’s the crisis that I see at the border. REPORTER: So you don’t see illegal immigration as such as a threat to the country. SWALWELL: Undocumented immigrants who come here for jobs, for opportunity, we need to have security at the border that makes sure that anyone who is not a lawful refugee is not able to come here. Anyone who is not going through the comprehensive process that we've set up is not able to come here. But I don’t accept the premise that the president puts out there that undocumented immigrants are creating a crisis in our country.","I think the biggest problem we’ve got right now starts down in Central America. The United States has withdrawn a lot of support in Central America. It’s a destabilized government. Gangs have taken over. And people are forced to flee for their lives. And as a consequence they end up at the American border, whether that’s what they really wanted to do or not, they’re pushed out. We want to have an immigration system that reflects our values. I think that what we need right now is an immigration system that does not build a wall. That’s not about safety, that’s a monument to hate. We need an immigration system that protects our Dreamers, that doesn’t break up families, that protects people who are here with temporary protective status and have built lives here, that reworks our visa program. Those are the kinds of things we need to be doing. An immigration system that’s consistent with safety and with our values. REPORTER: Would you say it’s a problem, but not the way Trump says? Or that it’s a challenge, but not a problem? WARREN: Can I say it differently? There are problems we need to solve in the immigration system right now. When I.C.E. locks up families, finds people who are coming to court to testify against bad guys, scoops people up in the hospital, that’s not increasing our security and it’s not consistent with our values. We need an immigration system that top to bottom is about our safety and is also about carrying out our values. We do those two things, we’ll have an immigration system that works.","I think even the languaging of illegal immigration is a problem in the United States. I think a lot of people don’t remember, perhaps never knew, that at one point Ronald Reagan just gave amnesty to eight million people. And before 1973, all people had to do, if they were not documented, was to go to a registry office. I think it’s so important for us to remember that immigration is a value in this country. It’s not just a policy. It’s a value. It’s a major spiritual and moral principle of the United States that we are open and welcoming to the stranger. You know, all four of my grandparents came through Ellis Island. And if you’re not descended from slaves who came from Africa, or if you’re not descended from Native Americans who were here for at least centuries before the white European settler came, who do you think you are? Who do we think we are? So, I think the idea of immigration is such a moral principle of public policy in the United States. And I think it’s important to remember that the immigrant brings at least as much to this country as this country brings to the immigrant. That is the characterological — you want to talk about exceptionalism, that is what is exceptional about this country, is the principle of belief that this should be a space of possibility for people to improve themselves and to have the lives they want — without the material caps that would otherwise thwart their dreams. So, I believe that what is going on today with the demonization of the immigrant is not just bad public policy, it’s immoral public policy. It is mean-spirited. It is unworthy of who we are.","So we have over 12 million people who are here in this country that are undocumented, that we know of. I mean it could be an even larger number. And we should not pretend that it is possible to somehow deport 12 million people. It would collapse regional economies. It would separate families. It’s essentially a non-starter. So right now, the status quo is we don’t know who everyone is and then we have problems with that and many of these people will show up in our emergency rooms or get into car accidents or other things where not knowing who they are is immensely problematic. And many of them are operating in an informal shadow economy where we aren’t having them integrated into the greater whole. And so I’m for a long-term path to citizenship for people who are here and undocumented. We need to create a path forward for people to see that they have a future here in this country. And this is particularly true because many of them have kids who’ve known no other life but America, and it would be, again, completely inhumane to separate families on that level."
9,9,Where would you go on your first international trip as president?,"I probably would go to Europe to reassert that the alliance is strong, that we care about NATO and we understand that it’s in our national security interest, as well as their national security interest, that we maintain the strong alliance that we have forged since World War II and that every president, until Donald Trump, has supported and endorsed. REPORTER: All over Europe, or a particular country? BENNET: No, I think, yeah — I think a lot of different places. I never thought about that. ","I think our alliances around the world have been frayed, so, first place I’d go is to the European Union to restore the alliances we used to have that were central to America’s strength in the world and America’s ability to protect itself. I think we’ve seen extraordinary rifts that used to not exist, because President Trump has been reckless. And we’ve got to remember that this is not a new normal we should accept: a president who attacks allied nations, attacks allied leaders, belittles folks who we need to be our friends. His attack on Mayor Sadiq Kahn of London really hit me personally. This is someone I value as a colleague and a friend. And Sadiq Kahn is an exemplary public servant and one of the great models to Muslims all over the world of the power of democracy to uplift people of all backgrounds. And to see President Trump attack him in just a belittling, demeaning way, was just one small example of a very destructive approach to foreign policy. So, the next president has to do a lot of cleaning up, a lot of repair, a lot of healing. I want to do that all over the world, but I’d start with our closest allies, who sure have felt like we have turned away from them in recent years. REPORTER: Any particular country you have in mind? DE BLASIO: I think it would be a group of them, but I can give you some if you want? REPORTER: Yes! DE BLASIO: O.K. I’d start with a trip to the European Union. To France, to Germany, to Great Britain, obviously — even though they’re in the middle of Brexit, they’re a crucial ally that we need to work with. We have to repair all of the rifts that Donald Trump created. And we have to show the people of those countries that we respect them, because they’ve sure been treated disrespectfully by our current president.","I’ve given a lot of thought to that, and it’s not something I’m going to be telling The New York Times about right now. I know you guys are trying to get a scoop, but I’ve thought a lot about that, and it is an important trip, both for substance as well as symbol, to talk about what my priorities are going to be. But one thing you should know when it comes to the international landscape, I have a number of priorities. Number one is the safety and security of the United States of America. And when I say safety and security, it’s not just about a strong military. It’s actually about having strong diplomacy, because I think that a lot of our military interventions have made the world less safe, as well as the United States less safe. It means rejoining our allies and affirming our alliances, not doing what we see now, which is bludgeoning them and weakening them. Because at the end of the day, America is the strongest nation on the planet Earth, but our strength is magnified and multiplied when we join with countries that share our values and share our sense of mission on the planet Earth for the affirmation of human rights, for the security and self-determination of people. My international agenda will be driven by American values, which are humanitarian values, which are led by democratic principles, which are understanding that we are one great nation in a planet that has many nations that need to work together in accord to achieve peace and security and human rights for all.","I think that the next president is going to have to build — rebuild — a lot of alliances that have been so important to America and global safety for decades. So I’d probably start by assuring some of our partners that we’re still that trusted friend. And that could be as close as Canada, it could be down to Mexico. It could be over to Europe as well. That’s what I’d like to do, and it’s not the first time that our country has had to kind of rebuild some of our strategic alliances, but it also may well depend on what the crisis at the moment is. REPORTER: So your first trip could be to Canada? BULLOCK: My first trip could well be to Canada. My first trip would be assuring our allies that the trusted partner that they’ve had for four decades will continue to be their partner.","Probably better become president before finalizing that decision, but I do think that there are so many alliances that the United States needs to shore up, that I would begin by talking to some of our closest friends. REPORTER: Are there any particular countries you have in mind? BUTTIGIEG: I’m not sure I’ve picked out one country that ought to be visited first. We certainly have regional security interests everywhere in the world. But I’d be concerned about recalibrating the way we talk to our competitors, too. So you could expect vigorous engagement with China and Russia early in my term. ","My first international trip would be either to Mexico or to Canada, because those are our neighbors. They’re the most important allies we have. They’re the most impactful nations when it comes to our economics in the United States and of course our security. We need to repair some relationships after this administration, including with Mexico and Canada. I would also visit our European allies soon after my inauguration to repair the damage that this administration has done with a number of countries in Europe and to embrace again the alliances that have helped make the United States militarily stronger, safer and economically more prosperous over the last several generations.","I think we have a lot of shoring up to do with our allies. So, I think I would do a large tour touching base with some of our most important allies, both in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region. We’ve walked away, and sent very bad signals on a lot of the most important alliances we have in the world, whether it be tearing up the Paris accord or withdrawing from Paris, whether it be questioning NATO, whether it be tearing up the TPP. So, my first international trip will be focused on our alliances and focused on shoring up some of our most important alliances, because I think the portfolio of allies the United States of America has is maybe our most valuable foreign policy asset.",That’s a good question. I’ll get back to you on that. REPORTER: Any sort of general thoughts on what kind of place it might be or what you’d like to do with that trip? GABBARD: No. I think it’s important for us to look at the threats that we have to our national security and to make our decisions about foreign policy accordingly.,"I think the next president really has to focus on bringing peace in the world. And, so, my first trip would be to the Middle East. REPORTER: Any specific country? GILLIBRAND: I would go to Israel, and I would travel throughout the Middle East and begin to have a worldwide conversation about what it takes to have peace. I think addressing what’s happening in Syria is an urgent issue right now, and I think making sure our allies know we are there for them. I would also engage with our NATO allies, and make sure they know we stand with them.","I think probably the first place I’d go is wherever — well, return to — wherever it is that we have American troops who are in the line of fire. I think it is critically important that a president of the United States have a full understanding of the conditions and the circumstances of any place where we send American lives to defend our values or our country. REPORTER: Do you think that practically means Afghanistan, or it could be anywhere? HARRIS: Well, we’ll see, because who knows what this president will do in the interim. REPORTER: That’s a little dark.","It depends on what the circumstances are at that moment. But, on a basic foundation, I would go first to our strongest allies. I’d want to go to NATO, to Europe, and reassure those allies who now are thinking, perhaps the United States is not the reliable ally that they’ve always believed. But then I would also reach out to the major influencers of the next century. By that I mean China, India, also Brazil and Turkey, some of these countries that are potentially our allies but would need to know that we are willing to be a partner and eager to help support them as they lift large portions of their populations out of poverty.","Don’t know the answer to that, but wherever it is, it will be a place where we build alliances rather than to break them down as Donald Trump has been. And when we build alliances, we are stronger rather than weaker, something that Donald Trump does not understand. So, I look forward to wherever that trip is, it’s going to reverse the course of chaos caused by Donald Trump in our international relationships. REPORTER: Do you have anywhere you’re thinking about, a couple places that you have your eye on? INSLEE: I think my first choice would be wherever we can reinvigorate the international effort to defeat the climate crisis. And whether that is Paris, to make sure we remain in the Paris Agreement, or another community to even build on that agreement, to be more ambitious and more aggressive, and to show American leadership to defeat climate crisis, that’s where I’ll go.","I would go to visit our allies. Right now, we have a situation where the president is dissing our allies or not standing with our allies. Look at how he withdrew from the international climate change agreement, from the Iran agreement to eliminate a nuclear capability in Iran. What I would do is, I would go to Canada, and I would go to visit our NATO allies, and I would assure them that America doesn’t stand alone in the world. We don’t coddle dictators. We stand with our allies.","I would go to some of our allies that President Trump has abandoned around the globe. You know, I’d start with some of our key old European allies that have always been important to us. I’d go to Canada and Mexico. I’d start with the allies that we have to keep close. My division motto in the Marine Corps was “no better friend, no worse enemy.” That should be the motto of the United States. But President Trump has done the exact opposite. He’s cozied up to our enemies and he’s abandoned our friends and allies across the globe.","I would go to Mexico, our most important neighbor, a potential ally as we address other significant challenges in the Western Hemisphere. If it is the out-migration from the Northern Triangle countries of Central America, if it is addressing the deep humanitarian concerns that we have in Venezuela, if it is making sure that we lead in concert with the other states of the Americas, that leadership begins with our relationship with Mexico. And it should be a relationship based on respect and trust and treating one another with dignity.","Europe. I would go to Europe. In fact, I already teased my wife that, within the first few weeks of getting sworn in, we’re going to have to go to Europe and really rebuild our alliances in NATO and make sure that our friends know that the United States is back, and we’re ready to take the responsibility of leading the world again. And I think that has to be the first trip. Maybe through Canada.","I have no idea. There are a lot of hot spots around the world. I think clearly we want to reaffirm our relationship with many of our traditional allies in Europe and elsewhere, relationships that Trump has certainly ruptured. And at the same time, we want to make sure we are sitting down with adversaries around the world. I will do everything I can as president to resolve international conflicts, not militarily but diplomatically. And that means reaching out both to our allies and to our adversaries.","My first international trip as president, I would go to Europe and reassure our NATO partners that we are still with them. The next president is going to have to take the oath, catch a plane, and go on a global affirmation tour. So, I would visit our NATO allies. I also would assure the South Koreans and the Japanese that we value the friendship and partnership we have there, because this president continues to threaten them that they should be paying us more for our presence in their countries. Our alliances are what reduce what we have to spend on national defense, they’re what keep us safe. I’m a parent of two kids, so I look at everything in parental metaphors. And if you were a citizen looking at our foreign policy landscape like a parent looks at a playground, you will have seen in the last three years that your child has gone from hanging out with the honor-roll kids — the French and the Brits and the Germans — to now, we roll with the detention crew — the Russians and the Turks and the Saudis. And it’s not just bad company; it costs us more if we can’t count on traditional allies, if we have to spend more at home, if we’re ripping up treaties that make us have to invest more in our national defense.","I think I’d go to Central America. I think I’d go down to where there are such terrible problems that cause people to flee, and to meet with people in that region and talk about how we can help them there, so that their lives are more secure and more stable. Can I have a second trip, though? REPORTER: You can have as many trips as you want. WARREN: Good. I’d probably go back to Afghanistan. I was there with John McCain, a year ago last summer. I think it was his last trip before he fell ill, and it was a moment to visit with our troops and visit with the Afghans on the ground and to learn how after — then — 16 years of American fighting in Afghanistan, that the Afghan government still only controlled about 60 percent of all the land; that it didn’t have the confidence of the people; that the opium trade was higher than ever; that the border with Pakistan was porous; that multiple terrorist groups had footholds throughout Afghanistan. To me, going to Afghanistan is a reminder of two things simultaneously. One is how our troops will do anything we ask them to do. All three of my brothers are veterans. These are people who will lay it all on the line. But the second is how careful we need to be in asking them to make that sacrifice — that we not only need to have a plan for how to get into a country; we need to have a plan for what constitutes success when we’re there and how to get back out. Staying for a hundred years is not a plan. Doing more of the same that’s not working, is not a plan. And Afghanistan is important for itself. We need to get out, but it’s also an important object lesson for how America needs to rethink every engagement going forward.","I don’t know where I would go on my first international trip as president, but I can tell you what my first international calls would be, and that is to the leaders of Europe to say, “We’re back, we’re back!” And also, I would call Jacinda Ardern — if that’s how you pronounce her name — who is the prime minister of New Zealand, because she has said that she wants New Zealand to be the country that is the best country in the world for a child to grow up. And I want to call her and say, “Girlfriend, you are on, because I want the United States to be that, too.”","It would depend upon what the circumstances were in the world, but I would let other leaders and other nations know that America is very eager to work with them to rebuild our partnerships and alliances, but I would want to know what was going on in 2021. It’s hard for me right now to say where I would go first. REPORTER: Is there any region of the world or country you’re eyeing? YANG: No. My first impulse is to go someplace that’s close to home. So, it would be someplace in South America, I would imagine."
10,10,Describe the last time you were embarrassed. Why?,"I’m sure it related to my children mocking me, which is the cause of most of my embarrassment. But I don’t remember. Do you remember? Oh yeah. I guess that the last time I was kind of embarrassed was after I yelled at Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate and my daughter Caroline was listening to that on TV and she said to her roommates, “Uh oh, I’ve heard that voice before.” And then, every time that a reporter wrote that mild-mannered Michael Bennet had yelled at Ted Cruz on the Senate floor, my daughters have always rolled their eyes and mocked me because they don’t think I’m mild-mannered.",I made a really big mistake and I wore cargo shorts to the gym and it happened to be a day when the media showed up. And I think my entire fashion reputation was destroyed all in the matter of minutes.,"I gave an interview just like this and they asked me what my favorite music was. And for some odd reason I felt like — to give unvarnished candor. And one of these guys has the most eclectic taste and when I was going through the stuff, I was talking about Common and Chance the Rapper and I love gospel. But he went on my Spotify account — I confessed to some of the things that were very embarrassing. And then literally I left the interview, and I go, “Did I really, not only name an artist that truly would embarrass me?” But also, I think I sang a line or two on that interview, which will not happen here, folks. I’ve learned my lesson.","Anytime that I can let down my kids, I would feel certainly embarrassed. But the last time over — I’m trying to think of, even these last couple of days as I’ve launched this. I’ve been pleased with what I’ve done. REPORTER: Any particular moment come to mind either in the last couple days or with your kids? BULLOCK: Nothing in particular, immediately at least, comes to mind of the last time I was embarrassed. Maybe even when I was walking in for one of these interviews and of course had stuff all over me, and they are like, “Come on, Bullock.”","On some level, something embarrassing happens to me daily. I don’t know if it was embarrassing or just comical, but I was trying to meet a pretty senior member of the House delegation and came in with my staff and security personnel to the Capitol. And while they were checking me in I kind of stood off to the side as I usually do when they’re putting together a check in process. And the lady behind the desk just leaned in to me and said, “Are you with them?”— pointing to my staff. I said, “Yeah, I am.” She said, “Are you staff?” I said, “No.” She said, “Well you need to wear this name badge at all times.” I was like, “O.K., I promise I will.”And it was a reminder that every day you can get cut down to size in a way that’s probably pretty healthy when you find yourself on the news all the time.","I just the other day, I was in Iowa, and I think there were like one or two journalists around and I was about to go shake hands with a woman there at an event and she said, “Oh, I love what you just did with that resolution in Congress.” And it took me a second and I said, “Oh, that’s actually my brother, Joaquin. He’s the congressman.” I get confused for my brother all the time and this comes in varying forms of embarrassment for me and for the person that’s actually, you know, that thinks that I’m Joaquin. Probably about five to 10 times a day, I get confused for my brother, depending on where I am. And it’s always a little bit embarrassing because, you know, the person has to say, “Oh, I didn’t mean that.” And I have to say, “Oh, it’s O.K.” So, you know.","You know, when you run for office you feel a little embarrassed every day. So, you know, I’m sure it’s probably happened even today. I mean, look, the thing about running for president in particular, you know, you find yourself in a situation where everything you do and you say gets analyzed, and you just get used to it. You know, some of it is, you know, can be kind of embarrassing things you say or you do a flub and someone asks you a question, and you’re like, “No, I didn’t mean that.” So, I just can’t think of the last specific time I was embarrassed because part of it is you really stop getting embarrassed.","That’s a good question. Sister, help me out here. REPORTER: It’s probably something you did. SISTER: Maybe. GABBARD: It probably is. I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that.","Every day. My children embarrass me — they don’t embarrass me, I’m embarrassed because of what they call me out on, all the time. It’s a daily thing. REPORTER: What have they called you out on recently that made you embarrassed? GILLIBRAND: This morning, I’m in the shower of course, and I am listening to my podcast about the news of the day. I’m listening to — what was I listening to? The NPR one. Something first. Something like that. Anyway, I’m listening to the news, and Henry comes in steaming: “Mom, you woke me up. Why are you playing your news so loud in the morning? So I was embarrassed because I recognized yes, I was listening to my news too loudly and I of course said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” And I quickly turned it down. Yeah, I was listening to “Up First.” That’s what I was listening to.","Oh. Oh that happens, I mean, that happens on the campaign trail. You know, it could be, I don’t know, just a funny moment, or, I mean, I just think it’s so important not to take yourself too seriously. And I absolutely believe it’s really important to be able to laugh at yourself. And, you know, I do that a lot.","I was with my son, who is 16, and used a term — a phrase that was somewhat crude — and I paused and basically it was describing flatulence. And he looked at me very seriously and then looked at me with pity at the very fact that I was embarrassed. Anyway, it was a typical awkward moment that one has with one’s family. REPORTER: Do you want to say the term now? HICKENLOOPER: I was talking about farting. Anyway.","The last time I was embarrassed: When I missed a hook shot with three seconds to go against Ballard High School, causing us to lose the game. A pain that still resides deep in my breast, which is only mollified by the fact that 50 years ago this last month we won the state championship. So, we’ll have to go with both of those remembrances.","Well, when you’re running for president, literally every day something happens that makes you embarrassed, but — and that you could laugh about because you have to find some joy in this because there’s a lot of funny things that happen. So a few weeks ago, I had a Fox town hall meeting in Milwaukee. And I was rushed to get to the airport from the capital, and I got at the airport, and they said, “You can’t check your luggage” or, “You can’t bring your luggage on. You’re going to have to check it at the gate.” And I said, “O.K.,” but then I thought, “Oh, no. What if the outfit I’m going to wear on that Fox town hall, the luggage gets lost?” So right there at the gate, I took out what I was going to wear the next day — my green suitcoat, my pants — and then I thought, “Well, I better bring some underwear just in case.” So I bring on my backpack, and just literally holding all my clothes. I get on the plane. I have to shove the backpack under. I sit in my seat, and this nice guy behind me as I’m onto this Fox town hall goes, “Hey, Senator. You left something there in the aisle.” And it was my rather brightly colored underwear, and I just want to say thank you to that guy. O.K.? No one else would say anything about it, but he did, and I survived the Fox town hall.","Oh my gosh, I get embarrassed all the time. I told a joke this morning that went totally flat. People didn’t get it. I was asked — it actually has to do with burgers. I was asked what I would do in an alien invasion. And I said, “Well, you’ve got to try diplomacy first. So, you’d sit down with the aliens and have a burger and a beer.” And then if the conversation didn’t go well, you could say, “Anyway, the last aliens who visited, they’re in this burger.” So, I don’t know, that joke just didn’t go over well. People didn’t get it and I felt a little embarrassed. But look, you got to be out there. You got to be willing to put yourself out there and that means you are going to get embarrassed sometimes. That’s O.K., that’s human.","I was — well that’s when I embarrassed them. I was at my daughter’s graduation, I was making too much noise cheering her on, and I could tell that she was embarrassed. I can’t remember. I’ll come back to that one. Cynthia, will you look up the last time I was embarrassed? I mean, I can think of a small moment. Yesterday, we were having a roundtable as part of a rollout of our immigration plan, and there were 20 extraordinary people from the El Paso community, immigration advocates, immigrants, former service members who enlisted while they were greencard holders, but had not yet become citizens. And in the middle of this really engaging, important conversation, I knocked over a bottle of water that was set on the ground before me, and was embarrassed that I had done that. That was literally the last time I was embarrassed.","You know if you call somebody by the wrong name — that sucks. I did that a few weeks ago. That was bad. REPORTER: Who was it? RYAN: Not telling. REPORTER: Was it one of your colleagues? RYAN: No, no — a person who I should have remembered.","I get embarrassed every day when I don’t do things. I have high expectations of myself and others, and too often I don’t fulfill my own expectations.","My wife told a story a couple days ago. A couple nights ago, I woke up in the middle of the night, I thought there were gunshots outside, and started running around the room and told my wife to get down and then I went into our kids room. And she’s like, “What are you doing?” And it was just fireworks and I was, like, in the middle of my sleep and she told that story to a bunch of our friends. And it was really embarrassing when she, like, explained out loud how silly and ridiculous I looked. They were just fireworks. Just wanted to protect the kids. I’ll be more careful next time.","Recently, in a photo line. I almost always, when I see a little girl come through, stop and say, “Hi. My name is Elizabeth. I’m running for president because that’s what girls do. And a lot of times we’ll do pinkie promises to remember that. And I did this with a child and said something about, you know, “It’s really important that we girls stick together.” And the mother said, “He’s a boy.” Ouch.","The last time I was embarrassed — the last time I was embarrassed, and why. I think right now because I’m kind of embarrassed. Because I don’t know what it is. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know the last time I was embarrassed and why.","I was embarrassed just the other day because I’m running for president. There are a lot of embarrassing things that happen to you on the trail. So if you ask me like the very last thing, I was just on, you know, on the street with someone and then someone wanted a picture and I was like, “Sure.” And then I went to their friend and was like, “Do you want a picture?” And there was like this awkwardness. And they were like, “Do you want me to want a picture?” And then I was like, “Well I’m not like going to impose on you.” And the whole thing was quite awkward. That sort of thing happens every day on the trail. It’s quite embarrassing running for president."
11,11,Do you think President Trump has committed crimes in office?,"It looks to me like President Trump’s committed crimes in office. I think, It’s pretty clear that he has tried to obstruct the Mueller investigation.","I believe the president has committed impeachable offenses. And I think there needs to be a congressional investigation to draw out the facts. I believe, ultimately, there’s a very good chance he will be impeached. But I also say that we should keep our focus and our national discourse not just on one person and not just on the political life inside Washington D.C., but also on the bigger issues affecting working Americans. Sometimes I turn on the TV and it makes me angry that all I hear about is politics and process, and not about everyday people. So, you know, you don’t hear health care being talked about, you don’t hear people’s real wages being talked about. You don’t hear how many hours people are working being talked about. There’s something wrong when our national discourse is too much about the legislative maneuvering and the parliamentary maneuvering inside Washington, D.C. So, yeah, I think we have a president who has committed serious crimes and I think it will catch up with him. But I also think our national discussion has to be, first and foremost, about American people on the ground, in all 50 states, and the lives they’re living. And I don’t think that’s happening right now.","I think that if you read the Mueller report, and with any objective eye, it is deeply disturbing and alarming that you have a president in his campaign that made dozens of contacts with a foreign adversary, and where I’ve heard people on both sides of the aisle say they should have reported that behavior immediately. Or those — that outreach that was done to the campaign immediately to the F.B.I. This was a campaign that embraced those contacts, that sought to benefit from illegally obtained information. That is wrong and then they lied about it, tried to cover it up. And then you have a president in office, if you read the Mueller report, that it’s a report about lies and deceptions, with a president doing things that Mueller thought could be amounting to obstruction of justice. And again, you see a president, in the most deceitful ways, trying to lie. Even ordering top aides to try to manufacture evidence to potentially obscure criminal behavior. This is a problematic report. It should — everyone should find it objectionable on moral vandalism on the values of the nation, and what should be the conduct of a president of the United States. Now, I think Congress needs to continue that investigation. They should get an unredacted Mueller report. They should have Mueller come before Congress in open hearings. They should get the supporting documentation and continue the evaluation to see what the nature of the conduct, what doesn’t amount to criminal activity, and should the president or should he not be impeached.","I think that President Trump has normalized behavior that we’ve never accepted. The notion that two a half years in, you know, over 10,000 misleading or false statements. What we used to expect out of our president and our elected officials is substantially changing. I can’t say that, you know — I haven’t seen either the full Mueller report or others, that crimes per se — but I think we can all expect a lot more out of our leaders.","There’s evidence that the president has directed people to lie to Congress. There’s evidence that the president has, at best, taken legally questionable action when it comes to sending hush money that might amount to a campaign contribution. There is an atmosphere of illegality and corruption around this president that has, of course, led to a number of prison terms, indictments and guilty pleas for his associates. Rather than defending himself, he’s basically asserted that, by definition, a president can’t be held accountable for this kind of misconduct. All the more reason why we need to be defending the rule of law in this country, because I think a full investigative process would bear this out, according to the principles of justice. But those principles are being obstructed by this White House.","We’re going to find out. This president has done a number of things that are unprecedented, at least in the last, I don’t know, hundred years. We still need to see the Mueller report. We need to understand what investigations in the House Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Southern District of New York are going to find about the president and his associates. In some ways the Mueller report was not the end of the story. It is really just part of the beginning.","I do, I think he’s violated the Emoluments Clause. Because I think it’s pretty clear to me, even though that’s somewhat of an obscure provision, I think what he’s doing with the Trump Hotel in Washington D.C. is a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which is why I’m a plaintiff on the lawsuit suing him for that. So, I think the president has conducted himself in a way where he has been lawless with respect to that. I think there’s a lot of other things he’s done that makes him unfit to be the president of the United States: How he conducts himself, how he questions the norms in our society, how he attacks the separation of powers, which is what I think he just did with his declaration of national emergency. I mean, the Congress just did his job pursuant to Article 1 of the Constitution, it actually debated border security and it funded it, and the president didn’t like that outcome so he called a national emergency. I think that’s a direct attack on the separation of powers and is in many ways, unconstitutional. I think the fact that the president has in many ways, sided with foreign adversaries over our own intelligence community, I think is, you know, a terrible signal to the intelligence community of the United States. But in terms of your specific question, do I think he’s broken the laws? I think he’s violated the Emoluments Clause, which is a violation of laws, yes.","I think that Congress is exercising its oversight in duties over this administration and will continue to do so. I think that the Mueller investigation, which I supported, set out to see if there was any collusion between President Trump and the Russian government. That report came back showing there was no collusion. I think it’s important for us to move forward in this country, come together to solve real problems and to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. REPORTER: Are there any other acts he’s taken, perhaps not related to the Mueller investigation or to Russia, that strike you as potentially — GABBARD: Perhaps that could be true and I think Congress is continuing its oversight duties to pursue those investigations.","I don’t know and I think it’s urgent that we receive the full Mueller report. Having a four-page summary of 300-page report is highly inadequate and we don’t know what is actually happening right now with regard to that investigation. What Mueller did not opine on is whether or not there was obstruction of justice, and was unwilling to reach a conclusion. I’d like to see the full report.","I don’t know. I would love to see the Mueller report and maybe we can talk about it after that. REPORTER: O.K. Do you think he will? HARRIS: Do I — I hope so. I absolutely believe that the Mueller report should be made public. We need transparency. The American people have a desire to know what happened and they have a right to know what happened. And Bob Mueller spent, with his team of some of the best professionals in the business, they spent two years — probably around the clock — working on gathering evidence and information that the American public should have access to. And certainly the United States Congress should in its capacity of oversight.","We don’t have all the information yet. Certainly, there’s a lot of evidence and discussion that he might have, but I am a believer that we have to support the process and the investigations that are underway and, you know, not make decisions before all the information is available. REPORTER: Does that mean waiting for Mueller or does that just mean waiting for — HICKENLOOPER: It’s not just Mueller. There are a whole number of investigations. Now, if the Mueller investigation comes forward and they have evidence that there really was collusion with foreign countries, obstruction of justice, you can have a list of all the allegations, then I think that we should proceed with charges. That being said, we need to get that information and make sure that from all the various investigations, and I think they’re more investigations still to come, let’s make sure we get the facts.","I think it is likely that Donald Trump has committed crimes in office, and that’s where I believe impeachment must remain on the table, and it is edging closer to the plate right now. And I’m proud that the Democratic party is insisting to get to the bottom of this, and the truth. Because we have to maintain democracy and its fundamentals, and I’m glad that we have a party that’s committed to that right now in the U.S. Congress.","I think he may well have committed crimes in office, and that is why he must be held accountable, and that is why we must call Director Mueller before the Congress to testify. I think that he has to testify before the House and the Senate, and explain and answer our questions. We had Attorney General Barr before us. Attorney General Barr many times said he didn’t know the answers to questions, and he actually told me that he didn’t know whether or not Director Mueller had reviewed the taxes and financial documents of the president. He specifically told me to ask Director Mueller. Well, I can’t ask Director Mueller if they won’t allow him to testify. A foreign power invaded our democracy. They didn’t do it with tanks or missiles, but they did it with a cyberattack. And every American should want to have the answers. That is why we need to have Director Mueller, Counsel McGahn and get the answers, and go forward, and the White House has to stop stonewalling. The other thing I would add is the obstruction of justice claims where I questioned Director Barr. And I would like to question Director Mueller at length. When you have the man in the highest office of the land, the president of the United States, who is basically making statements about family members of a witness committing crimes, to me that looks like obstruction of justice, and you’ve had hundreds of former law enforcement officials — U.S. attorneys, former U.S. attorneys, Democrat and Republican-appointed, say the same thing. This administration must be held accountable. That’s why they must answer the subpoenas and answer our questions.","Yes I do. And I voted, over a year ago, to start a debate on impeachment in the House. You know, the Congress does two things: We debate things and we vote on them. I don’t think the time is right to vote on impeachment. We don’t have all the facts yet. We don’t have all the evidence. But I think the party made a mistake to wait until now to start talking about this as a debate. We should have started this a long time ago. There’s ample evidence that the president has committed crimes or is certainly, you know, clearly accused of committing crimes that we need to investigate. That’s our constitutional responsibility in the Congress and we shouldn’t have waited until now. REPORTER: Which crimes are you referring to? MOULTON: Well look, I mean there’s obstruction of justice crimes, obviously in the Mueller report, but dating back before then there’s a whole Emoluments Clause — ways that he’s abusing the office. There are election fraud issues that have come to light. There are a lot of things the president has done that are against our laws, against our constitution and he should be held accountable to the laws that the rest of us have to abide by as well.","I believe President Trump has committed crimes while in office. From my reading of the Mueller report, and from listening to his statement during his press conference, it is clear that he felt that he did not have the authority to bring criminal charges, but felt that it was important that Congress, which can under the Constitution do this through impeachment proceedings, begin that process. Failing to do that creates a culture of impunity, and a precedent that some people in this country, because of the position that they hold, are above the law. And in the world’s greatest democracy, that precedent cannot stand. So as politically difficult as it is to confront this for some, we must for the future of this country and for the future of our democracy.","Oh, I don’t think that there’s any question that he obstructed justice. You know, you don’t have to be a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out that when your own legal counsel tells you not to talk to Jeff Sessions because it will be obstruction of justice. And a few days later, you pull him aside at Mar-a-Lago and have conversations with him about the very topic they didn’t want you talking to him about, that it is a crime.","Well, I think that is exactly what the House Judiciary Committee is looking at. I believe this president, Mr. Trump, believes himself to be above the law. I think he is contemptuous of the Constitution, contemptuous of the separation of powers and I support an impeachment inquiry in the House to determine, in fact, whether his offenses are impeachable. But I am also concerned and believe that if we go down that road at the same time we cannot ignore the needs of working families in this country. It’s difficult and Nancy Pelosi finds herself in a very unenviable position of trying to hold Trump accountable, while at the same time addressing the needs of working Americans in terms of health care, in terms of the cost of prescription drugs, in terms of climate change, in terms of immigration reform and many of the major issues that we face.","I think it’s very likely that President Trump has sealed indictments waiting for him, based on testimony that I’ve heard, both in an open hearing, but also in some of the other hearings that we heard. And that is unsettling to hear. And what we have to do now in Congress is figure out how we hold him accountable because what we do next will not only make sure that it checks an out of control, abusive executive, but also, it sets the standard for future presidents.","So, I read the Mueller Report. I started on the day it came out and thought, well, I’ll just get into this a little bit and read into the evening, into the wee hours of the morning. Got up the next morning and finished it off — 448 pages. And when you get to the end, there are three things that are absolutely beyond The first is that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election system for the purpose of helping Donald Trump. The second is Donald Trump, as a candidate, welcomed that help. And the third is that when the federal government tried to investigate the first two things, Donald Trump did everything he could to delay, stop, move, shift over that investigation. And now more than 600 federal prosecutors have said, if he were anyone other than the president of the United States, he would be indicted and brought to trial, that these are criminal offenses. Instead, what Mueller did is he said, under the rules of the Trump administration, a sitting president cannot be indicted so he served it up on a silver platter to the Congress and said in effect, “Congress, this one is for you to deal with.” Congress has one tool, and that’s the tool of impeachment. I don’t know how anybody reads the 448 pages of the Mueller report and arrives at any conclusion other than we need to start impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. And let me just say on this, this is not politics. This is a matter of the relationship between the president of the United States and the Congress. It’s a matter of protecting the Constitution of the United States. We don’t have a government that says, “Hey, listen. If the president gets in trouble, circle the wagons and no matter what, protect the guy at the top.” That’s how dictatorships run. That’s how monarchies run. That’s how autocracies run. But it’s not how our democracy runs. Our democracy says there are checks and balances, and nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law. It is absolutely critical that we start these impeachment proceedings as a way for Congress to say that this president cannot obstruct justice and neither can the next president or the one after that or the one after that or the one after that. I know that some people think this would be politically inconvenient, but there’s no political inconvenience exception to the Constitution of the United States. This is a point of principle about our future as a democracy.","It is a pillar of American jurisprudence that someone is considered innocent until proven guilty, and therefore, I would not say that the president has committed crimes, such for instance as obstruction of justice. Does it seem to me that there is a very good case for the obstruction of justice? Absolutely. Does it seem to me that there’s a very, very good case for other crimes as well — certainly for indictment? Absolutely. But until someone is convicted in this country, they are considered innocent. But I will tell you this: There have been moral crimes. There have been spiritual crimes against the principles on which this country purports to stand. And that alone, to me, is a reason for him not to be re-elected.","No. I think that it’s for Congress, and to some extent the American people, to determine whether Donald Trump committed crimes in office. I’m laser focused on solving the problems that got Donald Trump into the White House in the first place. REPORTER: So you don’t think he committed crimes in office? YANG: I don’t think it’s my job to determine whether he committed crimes. I think it’s Congress’s job since they are the ones who are in position to either impeach him or not."
12,12,Do you support or oppose the death penalty?,"I oppose the death penalty because I think, in part, it’s part of our broken system of mass incarceration that is not administered in a way that is equal, just or fair.","I’ve always opposed the death penalty. I don’t think our governments, historically, have been able to get to the truth consistently enough to have the right to take someone’s life. I believe that there are many serious offenses that deserve a long time in prison, even life in prison, but I don’t believe in the death penalty. There’s been too many times where we’ve found out, later on, that someone was innocent. And the government took away their life. That goes against all my values. So I believe, at this point in our history, we’ve learned the lesson the hard way. We’ve seen a lot of families suffer unjustly, and I don’t believe in the death penalty as a moral question, and I don’t believe it’s a deterrent, the way it was often made out to be. I think it’s something that should be a part of our past.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: And why? BOOKER: You know, all my life, growing up, I saw that we had a criminal justice system that was deeply biased against people who are low-income, biased against people with mental illness. We have a nation that’s biased against folks in a way that, as Bryan Stevenson says, that treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent. The death penalty reflects many of those deep biases in our country, and there’s a level of finality to it, that we know already that people have been sentenced to death and mistakes have been made. I cannot support a system that has shown deep, deep bias, a system that has shown deep failings, a system that is so final. I do not believe our state should be involved in killing its own people in a way that violates our principles and values. We can have justice without putting people to death. This is something I have been writing reports against since I was a kid in grade school, and I just do not believe in the death penalty. Our nation can do better in pursuit of justice for all and supporting victims of violence, as well as supporting the communities, so that violence doesn’t happen in the first place.","I support it in limited circumstances. I have been attorney general and governor in Montana, and during that time, never once — and Montana has the death penalty — never once has the death penalty been imposed or carried out. I think that there are both significant economic and racial disparities when it comes to the death penalty, but I wouldn’t take it off the table for the most extreme circumstances, like terrorism.","I oppose the death penalty. I don’t think it makes us safer, and the inequities by which it’s been applied in this country are extremely disturbing.","I oppose the death penalty. I believe that it’s morally wrong to take somebody’s life. More than that, that the death penalty has been used disproportionally against poor people, against communities of color. That we have seen plenty of examples, over time, of people who were put on death row, and then they have been exonerated. There have been some cases where people believe that, although it’s never been conclusively proven, that an innocent person may have been put to death. So, I’m against the death penalty.","I oppose the death penalty. As a matter of policy. REPORTER: What do you mean by as a matter of policy? Versus personal — DELANEY: I oppose it personally. It’s always in some ways a difficult question, because if something were to happen to someone who you really loved, your emotional response, I’m sure mine would, too, would be that the death penalty is appropriate. But as someone who wants a more civil society and someone who wants a society that advances, as it relates to how we think about human life and human dignity, I don’t see myself supporting the death penalty. I don’t think it accomplishes anything, and I think we can do better than that.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: And why? GABBARD: Unfortunately we still have a broken criminal justice system that wrongly convicts innocent people, issuing them the death penalty. Even one of those wrong convictions, taking an innocent life, is wrong.","I oppose the death penalty. I think the way it is implemented in America today is racist, and I believe our criminal justice system has serious issues with regard to institutional racism that must be addressed. And one of the things we can do is eliminate the death penalty nationwide, but also we should get rid of the cash bail system. We should deal with harsh drug penalties, and fully legalize and decriminalize marijuana, and look at some of the punishments retroactively. So there’s a lot of work that needs to be done in addressing some of the real injustices in our criminal justice system today.","I’m personally opposed to the death penalty. I always have been. And for many good reasons, including how it has been applied, which has been to really do it in a way that has not been in favor of — and has been against, actually — people of color, African-American men in particular, Latino men, poor people. It does not provide a deterrent. It is a policy that is about a final sentence, which is death, even though DNA has proven that there have been people sentenced to death who in fact were not guilty. So I do not support the death penalty for a variety of reasons.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: And why? HICKENLOOPER: The death penalty costs, in Colorado, it’s $14 million to $16 million per case. It’s random. So, depending on which district attorney is looking at how they’re going to try your individual crime, you’ll get the death penalty or not. It seems to have a great deal of bias in that decision. It drags. You go through a decade, maybe two decades of appeals, and it drives the family members of the victims of the crime through the worst experience of their lives again and again and again. And there is no evidence — I found no study that demonstrates that it is a deterrent. Those states that got rid of the death penalty decades ago don’t have any more crime or violent crime than those states that have a frequent use of capital punishment. To me, it’s a clear reason. Again, this was as I got new information and understood this, it became apparent why so many countries in the world have abandoned the death penalty. It’s really, in the modern world, not workable.","I oppose the death penalty. We’ve essentially eliminated it under my leadership, and I look forward to many more things we need to end racial disparity in the criminal justice system, as infected the implementation of the death penalty. It is why I’ve offered pardons to thousands of people in the state of Washington, for those who’ve been caught in the drug wars for misdemeanor convictions of marijuana. We need reformation of our judicial system to remove the long shadow of racial disparity in that system.","I oppose the death penalty, and I have long held that view. I held that view when I was the chief prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county. I believe we need to reduce crime. And when you look at the facts on the death penalty, you see that states that have the death penalty actually don’t have lower crime rates than states that have it, so that’s the first common-sense answer. The second: It’s more expensive when you have the death penalty than it is simply keeping people in prison who are dangerous, dangerous criminals for the rest of their life. And this is because of the cost of appeals and other things. The third thing, which is key, is there is already racial injustice in our criminal justice system. We know that. Well, the ultimate racial injustice is if you have a death penalty, where we know, from study after study, that the results of whether a jury is going to come out and vote for a death penalty and give a prisoner that sentence, that depends on the race of the victim, and also, the race of the defendant. So for those reasons, I am opposed to the death penalty.","I oppose the death penalty. Flat out. REPORTER: Do you want to say why? MOULTON: I oppose the death penalty because you cannot afford to make a mistake. And sadly, we know, through the amazing work done by people at the Equal Justice Project and other places, that mistakes have been made in the past, that the death penalty has been unfairly applied, even putting innocent people to death. And one innocent person put to death is not worth it. So, I’m flat-out opposed. It’s a moral issue for me.",I oppose the death penalty. Neither the federal government nor the governments of the states should be in the process of taking the lives of our fellow Americans.,"I oppose the death penalty. I think it is unevenly applied. We have innocent people in the United States who have been killed by the state for crimes that they did not commit. Until that system is fixed, we should not be applying it to anybody, maybe save a terrorist that would go through a certain proceeding. But other than that, an American citizen right now ... it’s not fairly applied. I think we should have a moratorium on it.","I’ve always opposed the death penalty. When we talk about the need for real criminal justice reform and ending the absurdity of the United States having more people in jail than any other country, part of the need for real criminal justice reform is for the United States to do what virtually every other major country on earth is doing. And that is not to participate in murder itself. The state should not be involved in murdering. You have people who’ve committed horrific crimes, people who are dangerous, people who should spend the rest of their lives behind bars, but I do not believe in capital punishment.","I oppose the death penalty. For seven years, I worked as a prosecutor, and I sent some of the worst people away for life without a chance of parole. That’s what I believe is the best sentence for anyone who carries out the worst crimes in our communities, but I do not support the death penalty.","I oppose the death penalty. And I oppose it on two grounds. One is that we’re not infallible as human beings. We make mistakes. And, particularly, the evidence suggests that we make mistakes that are racially tinged. We can’t do that as a country. I also oppose it because I think that people who have committed truly heinous crimes should die in prison. I think that is how we give them the maximum, maximum punishment that we can: keep them in prison for all of their days.",I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: Do you want to elaborate at all?,"I oppose the death penalty. It’s incredibly costly. We’ve made tragic errors in our past and likely will continue to do so, and our application of the death penalty is racist in many situations. And so, I would do away with the death penalty."
13,13,"Should tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google be broken up?","I think, first of all, all of those companies are different from each other and it’s worth thinking about that. I think we should absolutely examine whether they should be broken up and we should have the antitrust division of the Justice Department take a look at that."," I get very angry when I think about the fact that these huge tech companies, while they were profiting greatly, were part of what broke down our democracy in so many ways in recent years —the spread of misinformation, the interference by foreign governments in our elections, the ways that privacy was, in so many ways, undermined. There’s something wrong with the status quo, it can’t go on. And by the way, this is a country with a rich history of using antitrust laws to recognize when companies have become too powerful, too big, these tech companies are there. They are part of our society, they can continue to do their work, but we have to address the size, the power, and the concentration of power that now exists. It’s not healthy for our country. REPORTER: Can I ask you for a yes or no answer? de BLASIO: I thought I gave you one. REPORTER: Say the word. de BLASIO: Do it again. REPORTER: Should tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google be broken up? de BLASIO: Yes, we should use our antitrust laws. They’re there for a reason, and these companies have gotten too big, and the ramifications, the results for our democracy, have been too negative. We have to address that now, we have to break them up. ","I worry about any president that it makes — or presidential candidates — making broad brush determinations. We have processes and systems that, albeit are not working like they should. They should evaluate these things using a lens towards what’s in the best interest of our society. We have had a problem in our country of moving away from the kind of antitrust enforcement — we used to do in a more robust fashion that led to a fairer economy, to more shared prosperity. And I worry deeply, right now, about the corporate consolidation that’s affecting every sector in, to me, ways that are working against free markets and working against the interests of people. So from the pharma section, to the agricultural sector, we are seeing corporate consolidation in ways that’s worrisome. And so, as president of the United States, I’m going to make sure that we put judges in place that actually will enforce antitrust laws. I’m going to make sure that we have a Justice Department that does the appropriate investigations and breaks up many of these, or fights to break up of any of these unjust consolidations of economic power. And so, whether that’s the tech sector or the ag sector, or the pharma sector, I’ll be far more aggressive in enforcing antitrust laws. I think we have a problem with corporate consolidation and we’re hurting as a society. I’ve seen this painfully in many sectors, including the farm sector. I literally have put in a bill that said we should put a moratorium on corporate consolidation in the agricultural sector because the independent family farmers are hurting, being driven out of business, their share of the consumer dollar is going dramatically down. Because we have two or three companies who control the overwhelming majority of the seed, providing the chemicals needed for farmers. They’re getting squeezed from above by having instead of five or six people to sell their goods to, having one company dictating to them price. These are the kinds of things that we need the president to fight against. So I’m going to be one of those that does that kind of fight, because we need to create an economy that works for everyone, not crony capitalism and not unchecked corporate consolidation.  I worry about any president that it makes — or presidential candidates — making","I think tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google first ought to have a lot more obligations to our society. The fact that Amazon made $10 billion of profits, and didn’t pay any taxes last year, shows structural issues altogether. The fact that Google — half of its employees are independent contractors, don’t necessarily get the benefits and the wages that others do, it’s problematic. When it comes directly to breaking them up, you know, antitrust used to be about both controlling markets where Amazon now controls 80 percent of Internet sales. But it used to just be about the dollars, not from a privacy perspective. I think that we do need to take a look at, as they grow bigger, from the perspective of applying antitrust laws to break them up.","I think the F.T.C. needs to be empowered to prevent, and in some cases reverse, the mergers of some of these companies, not just in tech, but across the American economy. The consolidation can very quickly turn into a kind of monopoly power that diminishes our freedom and squashes competition. REPORTER: Can’t tell if that’s a yes or a no. BUTTIGIEG: I mean, there has to be a due process for something like this. But there is no question that the bar has been drawn far too lightly in my lifetime.","I think that that’s something that’s worth our attention. I do believe that at the Department of Justice, we need to scrutinize more, these kinds of big companies and potential mergers, whether they are in the tech industry, the telecom industry, agribusiness, any number of different industries. When it comes to agribusiness, for instance, one of the things that I’ve told the people of Iowa is that we need to ensure that we don’t only look at the impact of a potential merger on consumer price. We also look at what it’s doing to smaller companies up and down the production chain. So we need a Department of Justice that is focused, of course, on what it means to the consumer, but also what these mergers mean to small business. Perhaps, in some instances.","I think the first thing to do with tech giants is to significantly increase the regulation of them and make sure we’ve updated not only the antitrust laws in this country, but the communications laws in this country. So that they can be appropriately regulated and they don’t exercise monopoly power. Whether that leads to them being broken up or not, I think, will be a question to be determined once we have the appropriate regulation. I think we’ve been woefully deficient in actually regulating these companies. You know, I favor digital privacy legislation at the federal level very similar to what California has done. I think that’s the right framework. I favor updating the Telecommunications Act and our antitrust laws to actually address companies with the kind of scale and capabilities that many of these companies have. I favor putting in place other regulations on, you know, their ability to put political advertising out there without disclosure. It’s kind of ridiculous that they’re allowed to advertise, or politicians or, you know, political groups can put content on social media and not disclose who paid for it. So, I think there’s a tremendous amount of stuff we need to do around privacy, around making sure the American people have access to their data, they understand what their data’s being used for, to make sure that we have an economy where these companies just can’t gobble up any kind of new entrepreneurs or new startups that have promising technology because I think there’s some very significant antitrust issues associated with the concentration of power in these companies. So, that’s what I favor."," I do. I think that these tech giants like Facebook and Google have such monopolies and such power that — and there have been examples of their abuse of that power, both in invading and violating our personal privacy and civil liberty rights, as well as crushing any who seek to challenge their monopoly. ","I believe that monopolies are problematic in whatever industry they exist, and I believe there are grave concerns about monopolistic practices by the largest platforms that exist today. I think we need far more oversight and accountability because for anyone to be able to buy a Facebook ad in rubles just shows the lack of knowledge of their customers. They should have the basic requirements as a bank does to know their customers, so that they can’t be used to interfere with our elections. I think the platforms also need far more accountability and transparency in how they’re being used to sow disinformation and to provoke and spread hate. And so I’d like to see a far greater level of oversight and accountability. I don’t know what you mean when you say break up these institutions, so I don’t know how to assess that idea.I do know they need far more oversight and accountability and regulation.","I believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure, and the American consumer can be certain,that their privacy is not being compromised. REPORTER: But not necessarily to reduce the size of the company? HARRIS: My first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact, and that consumers have the power to make decisions about what happens with their personal information and that is not being made for them.","I think that we’re in a system in American capitalism, where large companies in many industries are making it much harder for smaller companies to succeed. If you go back over the last 20 years, we can see a clear decline in the number of new businesses that are being started every year. And part of that is addressing the enormous size of some of these companies. Now, we have laws and rules in place in how to approach the issue of, are these large companies in some way obstructing what we think our open market should do? And I think we should certainly be examining that. Certainly, again and again, these large mergers between our major corporations, oftentimes, the only real benefit to society is to the very narrow, that the infinitesimally small group of people that are their shareholders. In other words, when two large corporations in any industry merge together, the value capture team goes and decides which of the two teams of marketing, which of the two teams of accountants, which of the two teams in every sector of that company’s or those two companies operations, some people stay and some people go. And that’s the value capture. That’s where the merger makes economic sense. In most cases, that’s not helping the overall community. It’s just putting more people out of work. And I think that’s the challenge is when is too big, when is a company too big? We have processes in place to examine that and look at it just as Teddy Roosevelt did, just as Franklin Roosevelt did. I think that’s just going to be revisited frequently. REPORTER: But you wouldn’t, at this point, say those three companies — HICKENLOOPER: I think we have a process to go through rather than just me saying, me making a unilateral decision. We should be looking at a lot of these mergers and a lot of the size of some of these companies. The system now whereby you have — some of these large, behemoth companies that pay no taxes, and yet they’re creating remarkable share, shareholder value. Are they enhancing our open markets, our capitalistic system in America, or are they in some way beginning to compress the overall value to society? We’re at a point now where you step back and for the middle class, we need to be able to create security and opportunity for poor people. We have to create some level of security and certainly opportunity. In many cases, that’s no longer happening and we have to look at every possible solution to that.","I believe that we have to enforce antitrust laws. I believe that we have to regulate privacy. We’ve come very close to passing the best privacy laws in the United States so that those tech giants do not violate our privacy and do not violate consumer laws. Whether they are broken up depends on the specifics of the antitrust law as it applies to them individually. I’ve been very aggressive to making sure consumers are protected, I’d continue to do that.","They may well be broken up, but I think you have to look at the facts and you have to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws to figure out what should be broken up and how. One example when I’m president, I will make sure that we have a stronger Justice Department and F.T.C., and I will work to pass my bill and push it through from the White House to better fund those departments. And you can do it by charging extra fees on mega-mergers, and make sure the parties are paying for it. And some of that money can be used to look back at existing monopolies. I’m talking about things like Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and looking at the services and how all of this is integrated. We are literally in a new Gilded Age, and it is not just about tech companies. People question why pharma prices have shot up. Well, look at what happened with EpiPen. Look what happens with insulin. When competition goes away, prices go up, innovation goes down. It’s not just in tech. I am the ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, have long worked on this issue, and I’m excited as the president to be able to actually make this happen, and that means review of monopolies that are existing. That means better review of monopolies that are proposed, and that also means changing some of the standards that are in law right now so that we can adapt to monopsonies, and other entities because our government should be as sophisticated as the companies that are merging before us. And by the way, this isn’t some radical idea. This goes back to our Founding Fathers. It is Adam Smith if you want to look at the father of modern-day capitalism, who warned us about the standing army of monopolies. That’s what’s happening and we’re going to reduce competition and hurt capitalism if we don’t do something about this spreading problem of monopolies.","We should certainly be having that discussion. I don’t think we need to break them up right now, but we’ve got to regulate them more effectively. They’re controlling our lives. They have all our data and we are getting nothing in return. We’ve got a — there’s clearly antitrust issues going on with Google and Amazon in particular — and we’ve got to address this. This is part of regulation. This is part of reform. In the same way that the trustbusters in the early part of the last century dealt with these new big companies, like the oil companies, it’s our job in this generation to deal with these new conglomerates, these new monopolies, and make sure they’re playing fair, so that we can have good, free market competition around all things in the United States.","I don’t know. I don’t know whether it is appropriate for a candidate for the presidency, or for the president, him or herself, to be designating which companies should be broken up. But what I can say, is that we must have far stronger regulations to protect our privacy and our personal information. These tech giants are clearly unable or unwilling to do that without greater federal oversight. As president I would embolden the F.T.C., to make sure that there is far greater oversight and protection for people and their data, at a time when the people of this country have in effect become the products that are marketed on these platforms. Whether it’s Facebook, or Twitter, or Snapchat or Instagram, we need greater protections. And as president I will make sure that we provide them.","I think we need to look at breaking them up, and see what the ramifications are going to be of doing it. I think it is a discussion that we need to have. I wouldn’t be afraid to do it. But right now, I don’t think they’re meeting the standards that we need them to meet around privacy, around, you know, what we saw in the past elections, and a variety of issues. So, I think that’s a discussion we need to have.","The answer, in general, is yes. But I think this is an area that we are so far behind. Public policy is so far behind the explosion of technology that it is really one of the weaknesses of where we are right now as a country. When you talk about the power of tech companies, you’re talking about how we look at the workforce in coming years. What does artificial intelligence in robotics mean for the jobs that we’re going to have? You’re talking about the invasion of our privacy, the fact that these tech giants know more about us than anybody would ever dream that they know, etc., etc. So, this is a huge issue. Public policy hasn’t even begun to dent it. But I am very concerned, not only with tech giants, I’m concerned with Wall Street. I’m concerned with agribusiness, of the incredible power of a handful of giant corporations over the people of this country. We need an attorney general who understands antitrust legislation. And I think absolutely that that would apply to the tech giants as well.","No, but I do think the antitrust division at the Department of Justice could be better used, and that we need to start looking at anticompetitive practices broadly across tech. I also believe that we need a national privacy law so that, in our country, people are aware of how their data is being used, what they are opting into exactly, and also that social media companies need to have better — they need to take more responsibility for how their platforms are being used, particularly now, knowing that foreign adversaries are using their platforms to interfere in our elections. So, it’s the government starting to step up and exercise the authorities we already have, and social media companies, you know, being held to a higher standard and expected to do more to make sure that their platforms aren’t being misused.","Yes, I believe that tech giants, like Facebook, Amazon and Google, should be broken up. Look, here’s the deal. They run a platform — Amazon for example — where you can go and see 26 different toasters that can be delivered by tomorrow at 4 o’clock. And that’s where a lot of people who want to buy online, a lot of people who want to sell online come. That’s a marketplace. That’s great. But they are also running a business, Amazon is. So they watch, oh, who’s doing fancy things with coffee makers or pet pillows or whatever they’re doing. And they decide, you know, there’s profit to be made in that little corner of the market — pet pillows. So they take the little business that has invested heart and soul, put tons of money and time and energy and heart into this, and they move them back to page seven, put Amazon pet pillows up at page one, destroy the competition and suck up new profits for themselves. So, here’s how I see this: It’s like in baseball. You can be the umpire — that is you can run the platform, the marketplace — or you can have a team in the game, that is you can be one of the competing businesses. But you don’t get to do both at the same time. And that’s why they should be broken apart.","Giantism is a malfunction in the body, and giantism is a malfunction in society. That is why we have antitrust laws. That is why we have antimonopoly clauses. And so, yes, I believe that the tech companies have become giants in ways that make it very, very difficult, even for the free market. I mean how many young Mark Zuckerbergs might there be out there? How many young Jeff Bezoses might there be out there? So that’s why I think it’s — yeah, I have no problem with the idea of breaking some of these companies up.  I think giantism is a malfunction.","So, it is definitely the case that technology companies have become too big and that those industries have consolidated in ways that have been unprecedented. It’s also the case that Congress has been flying blind on this for 24 years because they got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995, and so if you have the sense that our government is decades behind the curve in technology, you are right. The temptation, though, is to say break them up, which is frankly a 20th-century solution to a 21st-century set of problems. And there are dynamics in technology, right now, that make it so that competition isn’t always the answer. As an example, none of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app. We just want to know what the best app is going to be that has the most up-to-date traffic info. So it’s not a situation where you’re like, “Oh, if we have more apps competing, like that’s somehow going to always be what we want.” Another example is that right now, to me, one of the primary concerns we should be having about social media companies is that we’ve seen a surge in depression and anxiety and mental health issues, among teenage girls in particular, that are coincident with the rise of smartphone use and the use of certain social media apps. As one of my friends in Silicon Valley says, “We have some of the smartest engineers in the country turning super computers into slot machines and dopamine delivery devices for teenagers.” So saying break them up in the case of Facebook, if you had Facebook broken up into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, that does not necessarily make our children any stronger. So there are certain situations where we’d want to divest. We would want to tech companies to divest parts of their businesses, that’s the “break them up.” But there are many other, more nuanced problems that we actually need to be working with these tech companies to resolve, and so it’s much more nuanced than a 20th-century solution to a 21st-century set of issues."
14,14,Are you open to expanding the size of the Supreme Court?,I don’t think the American people have been prepared to expand the Supreme Court. I think it would meet with the same fate as when Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court.,"I am not. I do not think expanding the Supreme Court makes sense, and I’ll tell you why: because of history. I admire so greatly Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but he tried it and it backfired in so many ways. I think there’s some things, we have to say are set, and then we have to work politically to make the changes we need. I think at this point in history, the best way to change America is through the electoral process, and that will very rapidly change our judiciary on many levels. It will take longer with the Supreme Court. But I worry that we end up in a kind of arms race if one administration increases the size of the court for their ends and then another party comes into power and increases it again. I don’t find that good for the country.","I worry about people that want to rush to expanding the Supreme Court, because I worry, where does that stop? It’s a race to the bottom. Does the Democratic Party get the kind of alignment of power in order to do that and expand it by a couple of justices, and then the Republican Party comes, and when they have an alignment of power, they do the same thing. And then one day my grandchildren will be asking me, “Hey, grandad, why is there 101 justices on the Supreme Court?” I want to you to know right now, I feel like the Republican Party and the Senate has done awful things that have abused constitutional intention, like denying President Obama in his final year what the Constitution says we should’ve done, which is hold hearings and advise and consent to a Supreme Court nominee. But I’m not sure if the cure to that is expanding the Supreme Court in a way that will be a race to the bottom. I think there’s things we need to do to begin to repair our democratic systems, so that they’re just and fair. And I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that we have people on the court that are not extremists, but that are going to return balance to our justice system.","I’ve actually argued in front of the Supreme Court. When I was there, and today, I’d love to think that it is a nonpolitical organization or entity. And when you saw what Mitch Mcconnell did with Merrick Garland — and we literally had an opening for a year — the idea that politics hasn’t played a role in this, I don’t think most Americans can believe anymore. So I am open to trying to say, how can we actually make sure that that court isn’t reflective of politics, it’s actually doing its job as the third branch of government. And expanding the court might be one way. REPORTER: Sounds like you are open to it then? BULLOCK: I’m open to making sure that, well, either be an expansion or other ways that we could turn around and try to get the politics out of the court.","I believe we need to reform the Supreme Court, but it’s not just about the number of justices. For example, when I’ve talked about having perhaps 15 members — an idea that will be floated in the Yale Law Journal soon — it’s not just about the number, but the makeup of the court. If we were to have 15, in a structure where five of them were chosen not through a political process, but by a unanimous consensus among the other 10, we might be able to reduce the politicization of the court. There are other reforms being talked about that could deliver a similar result. The point is not how many justices run the court. The point is not even how far to the right or left it is — though I do believe it’s become far too conservative for the American people. The point is, how do we change the trajectory of the court away from being viewed as an increasingly political institution? We can’t have an apocalyptic ideological firefight every time there’s a vacancy. And I think reform needs to be achieved in fairly short order, and in order for us to save the court that we need so much in terms of institutional credibility to keep our republic in good shape.","I don’t believe that expanding the size of the Supreme Court is the answer. And one of the reasons for that is that if Democrats go and expand the size of the Supreme Court tomorrow, what’s to say that five years from now, that Republicans won’t expand the size of the Supreme Court again to gain a partisan advantage? I’m more interested in proposals that have suggested, for instance, term limits on justices. If you set those terms at 18, 20, 24 years instead of a lifetime appointment. There have been other suggestions, for instance, that Democrats make a certain number of appointments, and Republicans make a certain number of appointments, and then some appointments are somehow jointly made. To me, those kinds of proposals are more interesting — and I think, more likely to be fruitful if we did implement them — than just increasing the number of Supreme Court justices.","I would be open to giving Merrick Garland a seat, because I think what happened to him was terrible. I think what Mitch McConnell did was unpatriotic, and in many ways an attack on the Constitution, so I’m emotionally supportive of something like that. But at the end of the day, I think that we have to support the norms of our society. And if we grow the Supreme Court during my presidency, if Congress decides to do that and grow the Supreme Court for political reasons, then we just have to expect that that’ll happen when the Republicans are in power. So, I don’t favor doing things that really are against the norms in our society just for short-term political reasons.","I don’t think that expanding the size of the Supreme Court solves the problem that we’re facing, where the court has increasingly become a partisan political entity. Even if you add more numbers to the Supreme Court, you’re still not going to solve the problem: how, unfortunately, those who are appointed are largely appointed on partisan reasons rather than making sure Supreme Court justices are chosen based on their commitment to upholding and defending our Constitution.","Expanding the size of the Supreme Court is something I am thinking about right now. I haven’t thought through all the impacts of that. I understand why advocates want to do that, because they feel like the Gorsuch seat was stolen from President Obama because he was not actually allowed to have a vote on his nominee, or even a hearing. So I understand people’s concerns, but I want to think more about it and do more research about what legal scholars believe the impact of that would be.","leave it there? HARRIS: No, just, I’m open to it. I’m absolutely open to it. I am open to that discussion. REPORTER: Do you want to elaborate on that, or","The discussion has been expanding the size. We’ve had the size of the Supreme Court for a long time, and expanding the size of it, I think, would require a national discussion, comprehensive in scope, and I think would have to be done in a way that balances our historical reliance on the system we have now. REPORTER: So maybe open but not very open? HICKENLOOPER: Yeah. I’m open to it, but again, the founding fathers put this country together. We created a Constitution and Bill of Rights and a system by which we manage our democracy. And if we’re going to change significant parts of that, we should do so carefully.","I’m open to any idea that can make sure a woman’s right of choice is protected, including a civil rights law by statute that would protect a woman’s right of choice. And I think that we should start by making sure that we do not allow the depredation of the theft of a Supreme Court seat which occurred. Which, by the way was not a theft from the Democratic Party, it was a theft from the American people. And as a person who potentially could make appointments, you could count on me to follow those tenets. REPORTER: Sounds like that’s a yes? INSLEE: I’m open to various ideas; I have not centered on any one. There are some new ideas about the potential of having court of appeals judges participate on the Supreme Court. I think these are worthy of consideration. But let’s not lose focus. The first thing we need to do is to get a new president and new senators that will not allow further theft for the American people of seats, and further appointments that jeopardize a woman’s right of choice, which is now under attack. And I’ve stood strong against the attacks on women since I first went to the legislature in a very Republican district in 1988. And I’ll continue to guard jealously that right.","I am open to it. It depends on what happens with the Senate, if that’s realistic. I think my much more practical focus will be on immediately, when I become president, filling open judgeships with people who actually have said they will follow existing precedent and follow the law. We have seen the Republicans marching through judicial openings, and I know that there were some delays when President Obama came in, in getting some of those seats filled. I lived it, I saw it, and I won’t let that happen when I’m president.","I am open to that. The fact of the matter is that the Republicans have played hardball with us, and we haven’t played hardball in return. I don’t know if the goal at the end of the day should be expanding the size of the Supreme Court, but we absolutely have to have that on the table. With what the Republicans did with Merrick Garland, they’ll try anything, they’ll do anything. And we’ve got to show that we’re willing to do the same.","I don’t know that expanding the size of the Supreme Court is the best way to address legitimate concerns we have with its objectivity, given the issues that it will decide. Whether it’s the future of women’s reproductive freedom, whether it’s corporate personhood, whether it is large donors, and corporate donors, and special interest donors in our democracy. I think the appropriate way to address this is to have fixed term limits for Supreme Court justices, to have some more regular turnover in their term of service, to decrease the temperature in the partisan fights that lead up to the nominations in confirmations. I think that’s the best path we can take as a country.","No. No, I think the Supreme Court should stay at nine. REPORTER: Why? RYAN: First and foremost, it’s really not even in the realm of possibility to get it changed. And I’m trying in this election to stay away from discussions that aren’t directly impacting, in the short-term, the lives of people who are struggling economically and trying to make ends meet. And to think that we’re going to be able to change the size of the Supreme Court, or get rid of the Electoral College, or any of these other issues, I think is moving us away from the real arguments that can help us win the elections that we need to win and win the election that is coming up in 2020.","I think Roosevelt tried that in the 1930s, didn’t work so well for him. Packing the courts is a great idea when you’re in power, not such a great idea when your political opponents are in power. So, if you go from nine to 13, and go 13 from seven, to 17 — it never ends. But I am open to the idea of rotating judges out of the Supreme Court into courts of appeals, for example, to allow them to get a new look at the real world that is out there. But I am not in favor of packing the courts.","No. I want to win. The best way to get a court that’s fair and qualified — as we say in the Bay Area, “Just win, baby.” And I don’t want to use expanding the Supreme Court or getting rid of the Electoral College as an alibi for failing to go to places where we need to win. If we go and win in the South, if we win in the Midwest, we can have a court that reflects America’s values. And I’m committed, if I’m the nominee, to going across the country to help us win the Senate so we can do just that when I take office and appoint Supreme Court justices.","I’m open. REPORTER: Do you want to expand on that? WARREN: No. Actually, I mean, we could. Because the point is, there are a lot of different ways to do it. The number of people on the Supreme Court is not constitutionally constricted. But it’s one of the things that we could certainly talk about.","I’m not convinced that expanding the size of the Supreme Court is going to fix anything. Because I think that the same drama will play out. The same kinds of proportionality issues will play out. Also, another problem I have with the idea of expanding the Supreme Court is that, right now every time there is a nominee for the Supreme Court, the popular imagination is engaged. People know, “Wow, there’s a new Supreme Court nominee,” and we understand about the nine. If we have too many, I think it’ll be just like, “Oh, there’s a new Supreme Court nominee,” which seems to me even more dangerous. So, no, I’m for staying with it the way it is.","There is nothing in the Constitution that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. And if you look at what’s happened with our Supreme Court, it’s become intensely politicized, but it’s also become a firestorm because of lifetime appointments, where right now we literally are anxious about the health of an 86-year-old justice because we think the law of the land may hang on the balance of her health. So the first thing we have to do is, we have to do away with lifetime appointments for Supreme Court justices. We have to make it 18-year appointments, which is still plenty long and enough to make you immune to political vacillations, but it’s not a lifetime appointment. I mean when the Constitution was written, our life expectancies were much shorter and Supreme Court justices regularly stepped down for any variety of reasons. It was not a situation where they were clinging to the court until they’re on death’s door because the law of the land depended on it. So it would make total sense to institute a term limit of 18 years, and it also would make total sense to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court, because then when someone stepped down it would become less of a political crisis or firestorm. Other societies have had supreme courts that have had significantly more justices than nine, and then when someone steps down or rotates off, it’s not as big a deal. So the answer is, yes, I would obviously consider having more justices on the Supreme Court."
15,15,"When did your family first arrive in the United States, and how?","When I was in the second grade, we were asked to line up in order of whose family had been in the country the longest and whose family had been in the country the shortest. And I was the answer to both questions. My mom had recently arrived, when she was 10 years old, as a Polish Jew who had survived the Holocaust. My dad’s family had been here since the Mayflower came to the United States, or what was then America — what was then not even America.","I’ve got a tale of two sides in my family and two very different stories. One half of my family came very early on in the history of this country. Folks who were here, literally, in the first decades of the European settlement of the United States. My family’s proud of that history, and it’s part of the lore I’ve heard at family gatherings about our ancestors who were here from the very beginning. But the other side of my family, my mom’s side, comes from Southern Italy. And I’ve been to the two towns that my grandparents come from. My grandfather Giovanni and my grandmother Anna, they come from really small towns, mountain towns in southern Italy, about the farthest thing you could imagine from New York City. And each of them came here not speaking English, only having a few family members here already in New York, not having any amazing skill that they could bring and make money right away. They came here because, at that point in Southern Italy, there was very little opportunity, and they came here hoping they could do something different. And they literally live the American dream. They met here in New York, they had three daughters, and all of them, including my mom, went to college, both from parents who never even got close to going to college. So we’ve experienced that extraordinary American immigrant experience on that side of the family. I’m the second generation born here in America. My mom spoke Italian before she spoke English, and yet, she was able to go to Smith College and have a professional career. We’ve lived that American dream, and it’s beautiful. And we’ve got to keep it now. We’ve got to protect it because it’s not happening for a lot of people now. So many new immigrants are not being treated with the respect they deserve, and I draw from that very, very deeply. I know that my own grandfather, who I knew well and I loved very deeply, I know that in some of the way you’re hearing immigration talked about today — when Arizona had those laws calling for law enforcement to single out people who might be immigrants — my grandfather in his time would have been one of those, obviously, with a thick accent, and a different look from Southern Italy. And it would’ve been 100 percent clear that he wasn’t from here. And yet, he was as exemplary a person as you could imagine and he did so much for his family and he loved this country, and that’s part of what animates me to respect all immigrants today.","I was really privileged to be a part of a show called “Finding Your Roots.” A little embarrassing, because they do it in tandem, and it was done with me and John Lewis, and I knew there was going to be problems when they opened the show with the biographies of two people. And it starts off by: “John Lewis, hero of the civil rights movement, standing on the Edmond Pettus Bridge, he literally bled the Southern soil red for freedom.” And then it goes to Cory Booker: “Cory Booker, growing up in suburban New Jersey, riding his big wheel.” I mean, the comparison is outrageous. I was always taught that I stand on the shoulders of giants, and when Henry Louis Gates, Dr. Gates, did that analysis of my history, it blew me away to see my roots. To see that I am the descendant of slaves, of people that were born from a slave and a slave master. To see that my ancestry goes back to before the founding of this country. He found one branch of my tree, I am a direct descendant of people who came here from England in 1640. And so, when I saw where my family tree and where my roots go, to every imaginable corner of our country, I was profoundly humbled to know that from slaves and slave owners, from people stolen from Africa, to people who came here centuries before this nation, over a century before this nation was founded, it made me even more deeply proud and feeling even more deeply connected to this country’s history, and more importantly to the urgent call that I have, knowing I can’t pay my ancestors back for all the struggle, all the sacrifice, all the survival under conditions that were unimaginable. That the only choice I have right now to honor our history is by paying those blessings forward.","I should know that, and I don’t know. I know that the family history is probably not as solid ... and I know that on my mother’s side, I think her great-great-grandfather settled in Henry County in Iowa. On my father’s side, I’m not sure where.","My dad came to this country in the ’70s. He stepped off an airplane at J.F.K. He said it was such a chaotic and intimidating scene that he briefly thought about getting right back on a plane and heading home. But he had come to this country for an education. He knew it was the best place in the world to study, and became a graduate student, and then became an American citizen. My mom’s people go, I think, way back. Scots-Irish folks who settled in Southern Indiana. And they met in New Mexico when they were both teaching out there.","Well I grew up with my mother and my grandmother. And my grandmother, her name was Victoria Castro. She came to the United States when she was 7 years old with her little sister. They came from Mexico because their parents had died. And so she ended up living on the west side of San Antonio and raised my mom as a single parent. She was a wonderful woman. Worked her life as a maid, a cook and a babysitter because she never finished elementary school. That’s on my mom’s side. On my father’s side, his relatives had come over from Mexico at the turn of the century in about the year 1900.","If you go back and think about my grandparents on my father’s side, my grandfather’s name was obviously Delaney, but my grandmother’s name was Barlow. And on my mother’s side, they were Rowe and Lynch ... so I’m three-quarters Irish and one-quarter English. My grandfather came here — on my mother’s side, this is my grandfather who was from England — he came here in 1923, and he immigrated here from England with his seven brothers and sisters. They came on a ship .... It was interesting when I went back and read about their journey here, the day they came to New York, they came on one of 15 ships who pulled into New York Harbor, delivering 15,000 immigrants on just one day. And he came with his seven brothers and sisters and his mother, but he was actually detained when they were coming in. So, his seven brothers and sisters were let in, his mother was let in, but he was detained. The reason he was detained, is because he only had one arm. So they basically sent him to Staten Island, he was going to be deported, but his family got him an appeal. The appeal was held in the Great Hall of Ellis Island, he was a little boy, he only had one arm. He had lost his arm in England when he was a boy because he was playing in a field with a World War I shell that had not exploded until he played with it, and then it exploded, and that’s how he lost his arm. So while he was waiting to get his appeal, the judge walked in who was hearing these appeals. And my grandfather saw that the judge also had one arm, and that was the only reason he was let into this country, because the one-armed judge basically ignored the rules. The rules were back then, we didn’t let people into this country who had a disability, because we wanted able-bodied men and women, and in their eyes, they thought people with disabilities didn’t meet that standard. He was only let into this country because he happened to have a one-armed judge who saw the one-armed boy and told him to go make something of his life. So that’s the story of how my grandfather got here. Then he ended up working in a pencil factory in Jersey City, New Jersey. My grandfather on my father’s side, he was a dock worker in Jersey City, New Jersey, so most of my family is from Jersey City. I grew up in a town called Wood-Ridge, which is not far from Jersey City. That’s where my parents settled, and so that’s a little bit about my grandparents.","My mom is from Michigan and my dad is born in American Samoa, and our family moved to Hawaii when I was 2 years old. REPORTER: And where was your mom’s family way back before they were in Michigan? GABBARD: Way back, my mom’s family came from different parts of Europe and my father’s family came from New Zealand and also different parts of Europe.","On my mother’s side, her parents were from Ireland and Scotland, and they came probably four generations ago. My father’s side, his mother and father were from Eastern European countries. Places like Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany. And they came probably four generations ago, too. So my parents’ parents were born here, but their parents, some of them may have been born abroad.","Well, my parents arrived in the late 1950s. My mother came from India to go to the University of California, Berkeley, to study science.",,"I don’t know how my family first arrived. We have some lineage that goes back to England and Wales, and beyond that, the path is murky. And we’ve been very fortunate as a family, I’ve been very fortunate to have a great family, and I’m looking forward to having several more generations of Inslees — if we defeat climate crisis. The Inslees stand strong against that climate crisis.","Well, my family arrived over a century ago on the Slovenian side, my dad’s side, that came over to work in the mines in Northern Minnesota. It was not a easy life, but they did it because they thought it would be better for their next generations to come, and it was. On my mom’s side, it’s actually the most interesting. My grandparents came over directly from Switzerland. My mom, when she was a little girl — or, my grandma, when she was a little girl, and then my grandpa when he was around 18 years old. And he came through Ellis Island, and they had met the quota on Swiss immigrants, so he said he was going to Canada. He just stayed there a week, and he somehow found his way into Wisconsin, where he met my grandma and married her. But what was really interesting is the whole time, for decades, he remained an alien. And right before World War II, they made aliens register, because they were looking for communists. And he registered, and they asked what organizations he belonged in, and he said, “The Swiss Male Choir,” so he got registered as an alien, and then he decided he wanted to try to be a citizen. That’s when they found out about the fact that he had entered our country twice and he hadn’t really stayed in Canada. There was a hearing and they allowed him to stay, and he became a citizen just a few weeks before we entered World War II. And I have this picture of him smiling with his bow tie on, and I often look at that photo of my grandpa, and I think, “What would have happened to him now? Would he have been deported, like so many people are in this country, when he was just trying to make a life for his family, and raise my mom and her brother?” Probably, and then I wouldn’t be a U.S. senator. And it’s one of the reasons that I fight every day for immigration reform.","So, we’re an immigrant family from the early 1600s, so we’ve been here a while. My dad’s side came from England around the 1630s, and I think my mom’s side, the Meader family, came a little bit later, also from England. They both ended up around southern New Hampshire, so very much a New England family from the start. REPORTER: You don’t have any ancestors in Iowa or South Carolina, do you? MOULTON: I’m sure we’ll find them in this process if I do.","Well there are lots of different family members who proceeded me, depending on how many generations you go back, but I know that the O’Rourkes came from Ireland in the 19th century. There are family members on my mom’s side who came 100 years before that. But I’d like to think that my family members are part of a long tradition in this country of welcoming immigrants and asylum-seekers and refugees from the world over. The fact that this country is founded on the basis not of race, or ethnicity, or common ancestry, but this idea that we were all created equal. The idea being to equal opportunity, and an ability to make this the greatest country on the face of the planet, because we are a country of the people of the planet, who have found a home here. So my story, perhaps not unlike many other people’s stories, begins with those first immigrants who arrived here in this country.","My dad’s side, my Irish side, got to the United States in 1829, I believe, through Philadelphia. And my mom’s side — she’s a hundred percent Italian — her maternal grandmother came in the early 1900s. My grandfather’s family came in right around then too, early 1900s, like 1910, 1912. His family came from Calabria in Italy, and my grandmother’s family came from Basilicata in Italy, just a little bit north of Calabria.","My father came to this country when he was 17 years of age. I am not quite sure of the year right now, probably give or take around 1920, I don’t have that in my head right now. My mother’s family came some years earlier. My mother’s family came from Russia. My father’s family came from Poland. And when we talk about the fact that I am the son of an immigrant, I am somewhat sensitive to the issue of immigration and immigration reform, and the kind of ugly attacks that we’re seeing right now on the immigrant community.","The Swalwell side of my family came to the United States just at the turn of the 20th century. They came from England. My mother’s family came from Denmark. My parents were both born — my dad was born in the San Francisco Bay Area and my mom was born in South Dakota. REPORTER: What brought them here to begin with? SWALWELL: I don’t know too much about my ancestry. I actually learn a lot on the trail from people who think they’re related to me, and we kind of share notes. But as far back as I can really go, my father’s dad was a mechanic and my dad was a police officer, and my dad’s dream was that I would be the first in the family to go to college. So, I imagine that if they came to the United States at the turn of the century, that, like many immigrants at that time, they came to America to seek what I try and make sure is still available, which is the idea that if you work hard, it adds up to you doing better. No matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, and dreaming bigger for your kids.","Oh, there are a lot of different pieces to this story. On my father’s side, my father’s grandfather came over as a boy from Europe and met my father’s grandmother, who was also European, and they ended up farming in Missouri and then ultimately in the territory of Oklahoma. My great-grandfather helped two of his sons set up what were called hardware businesses in little towns in Oklahoma — Wetumka, Oklahoma, and Sallisaw, Oklahoma. And those stayed in the family, the one in Wetumka for another generation. First my daddy and then my Uncle Jack worked there. But they’ve both gone out now.","All four of my grandparents came from Russia and Poland, that area there. My grandfather had been conscripted in Russia for service for 25 years. Jews were conscripted for 25 years of service. My father’s mother was pregnant with him when she crossed on the boat over. He was born here. The story of my family and its immigration to the United States is one of those very typical, but very moving, stories of immigrants who came with very, very little and found everything.","My parents immigrated to the United States in the 1960s. They were both students. My father got his Ph.D. in physics at U.C. Berkeley. My mother was studying math and statistics at U.C. Berkeley, and then they met. My father wooed my mother, told her she’d never have to wash test tubes again, and then they got married right after they graduated from U.C. Berkeley in the late ’60s. So they arrived as students."

18,18,Does anyone deserve to have a billion dollars?,"People in a capitalist country are going to have a billion dollars, but we’ve got the greatest income inequality that we’ve had in a century. We have no economic mobility left in this country and for 40 years, the bottom 90 percent of Americans haven’t shared in any of the economic growth. That is the central challenge of our time. A democracy cannot survive this lack of economic mobility, and that’s what the next President has to address. REPORTER: Sounds like you think people will have it, but they do not necessarily deserve it? BENNET: I think that our tax code is desperately unfair. I think that we’ve cut taxes by five trillion dollars, mostly on rich people, since 2001. Donald Trump made that even worse with the tax cut that he passed, and I don’t think it makes sense to have these massive transfers of intergenerational wealth that we don’t tax. So that’s something that we’ve got to fix.","Look, people work hard and make a lot of money. I don’t begrudge them that they earn their money. What troubles me is the fact that the Federal government so often favors the wealthy over working people. I look at this country, and for decades now, there’s been an agenda in place that favored the 1% that use all the tools of the Federal government to put more money in the hands of the few and to, very consciously, avoid rewarding the folks that do the hard work every day. That’s why so many working class and middle class Americans feel they’re working harder and harder and they’re getting less and less for it. One of the things I talk about, very bluntly, is there’s plenty of money in this world. There’s plenty of money in this country, it’s just in the wrong hands. It has been very clear to me that money’s gotten concentrated in the hands of very few people because of federal policies. And that’s created a sense of unfairness, a sense this society is no longer working for working people. This election has to be about whether we’re going to have a fair economy or a fair society again. Whether work’s actually going to be rewarded. If we don’t fix these problems, I really fear the kind of income inequality, the stratification that undermines the social fabric of this country. And not just the social fabric of this country, but undermines our national security because we will not be a unified country if this level of inequality continues to grow.","I think that we make a mistake in this country when we confuse wealth with worth, and I think the nation and the values we have are really being challenged right now. That, not only people will mistake wealth with worth, they may mistake celebrity with significance. And so, I think the strivings we should have should be to make a contribution to make a difference in the world. So, you know, how much money you have, to me, is inconsequential to what you do with that. And this idea of shared prosperity, not just economically, but shared prosperity in terms of well-being, in terms of a meaning in life, I think that this is a challenging point in American society, where we see forces trying to erode what gives life meaning and substance. And I think that’s why we’re seeing this rise in deaths of despair from opioid addiction to suicides, and we really need to start talking about, not what’s a matter with us, but what matters to us as a society. REPORTER: Does it bother you, though, to see people with that much wealth, or is it really a question of making sure it’s a broadly shared properity? BOOKER: You know, what bothers me is when we are a nation that got here, not because of rugged individual and our self-reliance, but because of this idea of a shared purpose and common sacrifice. I’m bothered when people don’t understand that they have an obligation to use their best measure of devotion, of resources, to sacrifice for the greater good. And knowing that we’re all here because of people that were willing to storm beaches in Normandy or Iwo Jima or people that were willing to stand together and die together for worker’s rights, for civil rights, people like Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, who gave the ultimate sacrifice, for people to live lives that are not oriented around that understanding that we must do for each other, that frustrates me. But, again, this should be an everyday struggle. I always tell people that the biggest thing you can do anything today is a small act of kindness and decency or generosity. So, I try not to cast judgment. I struggle everyday to live up to my own ideals of service and contribution, and whether that means, hey, when I earn money, I try to make sure that I’m being generous with that and evidencing the values I want to see in the world, and before I cast judgment on another, let me live by my own values, because you can talk about people with a billions dollars, but heck, I’m, as a senator, I make $175,000 a year. What am I doing with my resources, before I point to someone else?","To me at least, it’s not about, it’s about everybody actually deserves to have enough money and the opportunity to feed their family and live a better life than what they lived growing up. And I think far too often now, you know, I grew up in the 1970s, 90 percent of 30 year olds were doing better than their parents were. Now it’s only half. 44 percent of America, if they had an emergency where they needed $400, they’d either have to borrow it, or go somewhere else. So the average American worker hasn’t really had a real pay increase in 40 years. So yes, someone may well deserve if they earned a billion, but I’m more concerned about the person that deserves to be able to take care of their family and live a better life than their parents did.","I’m not sure anybody cosmically or morally deserves to have a billion dollars, but I don’t hold it against them, as long as it’s a part of a system where there’s economic justice felt more broadly. I think the reason you see a lot of resentment of billionaires today is not strictly because of how well they’re doing, but how well they’re doing in an environment that seems to route virtually all of the gains of human productivity toward a tiny number of people.","If they’ve worked hard and come about it fairly. But I agree with people who say that our system is out of order right now. That we have tremendous income inequality. We have too many people at the top who are doing very well. And more and more people in the middle class and near the bottom of the economic scale that are doing worse and worse. And that’s why we need a Washington that actually works for people who are working hard and rewards hard work, instead of making it easier and easier for the people that are at the top, expecting less and less of them and a very big corporate interest.","I think, for example, if someone were to create the machines that would solve climate change and they did that as an entrepreneur in the private sector and created extraordinary innovation that added massive value to the world, and they made a billion dollars off of that, I don’t have a problem with that. To me, the real question is not, do people deserve to have a billion dollars, but, do we deserve to live in a country where half of the population can’t afford $500? Do we deserve to live in a country where so many people struggle? And I think the answer to that, particularly for the people who are struggling, and for all of us as citizens is, no. So I think of it more in that way. I don’t worry as much about what people at the top do. You know, if they’ve played by the rules and done a great job, and live in a free market capitalist society and are very successful. But, I worry deeply about people who are struggling, who don’t have opportunities, who have been left behind, who really have just such a difficult burden in their day-to-day lives, living in poverty, and being oppressed. And I really want to do things to help those people. And to do those things, sometimes it requires money when you have to have tax policy that inevitably ends up taxing those who have been most blessed and most successful in life. So that’s kinda how I think about it. REPORTER: So that sounds like a yes, but a qualified yes. DELANEY: Yeah, because I’m not sure deserve is the right question. I don’t know if that’s the right question. We live in a free market economy. If someone in 200 years makes a billion dollars, what does it mean compared to today? I’m a capitalist, I believe in the extraordinary promise that the free market provides to people in terms of the ability to lift them up, that it’s the greatest innovation in the job creation machine, ever. But I believe really strongly in strong social programs to help people who are struggling to make sure young people have opportunity, to protect our citizens against threats, and those programs often come with a cost. So, yeah, does someone deserve a billion dollars if they do something great? Sure. But what we don’t deserve is to live in a country where so many people struggle.","Look, those who work and earn money in this country, it’s not a bad thing. It’s how they do that and what they do with it, I think matters. I think the fact that we have had such an imbalance in our country with vast income inequality, where our laws benefit the very few, making it easy for the richest to get even richer, while the middle class and the poor continue to struggle is what’s wrong, and that’s what we need to fix.","I think the American dream is about letting people aspire to whatever they can accomplish. But your question I think goes to a bit more of fairness and how we invest in our whole community and the common good, and I think those who are deeply successful should invest more.","I mean, if they earn it and work hard for it, sure. But let’s also be very clear that we should never make an assumption that everyone has equal opportunity to earn a billion dollars, because most people in our country do not. Most people in our country are not starting out on at a level that allows them to have access to an opportunity for economic success, and we have to correct for that. For so long, really for generations, the rules have been written in a way that have excluded working people, have excluded middle class families, and we’ve got to address that. I will never be upset with anyone for achieving success, but never should we assume that everyone has an equal opportunity to get on that path of success, because that’s just not the case in our country.","I think that people in this country have always had these aspirational values to make a billion dollars or to make, you know, in the old days, it used to be, to be a millionaire and I think that’s what drives a lot of our economy. The question is, people that make large sums of money, is there not some obligation that they should help create opportunity or enhance the opportunity for others to be able to have the same success, the same achievement that they did.","You know, there’s a line from one of my favorite movies “Unforgiven,” Clint Eastwood, where he says “deserves got nothing to do with it.” The question is, how do we really have an economy that works for everyone. And 50 percent of Americans have not had a raise. When I’m president of the United States, we’re going to have a jobs program that I just rolled out for eight million family waged jobs, that’s what America needs. REPORTER: Was that a yes or a no? INSLEE: I don’t know how to call it deserve. Deserve is in the eye of the beholder. What we need is an economy that grows wages for those in the bottom half who haven’t had a wage increase in the last 20 years. That’s what I want to focus on.","I think that people deserve to work hard, and make money, and they can make a billion dollars, but the key to me is: How does our country make sure that there’s shared prosperity? That means if you got a billion dollars, you should be sharing more of it with your fellow citizens, presumably, those are the citizens that basically made the economy work for you. You should be sharing that prosperity in terms of where we put taxes, how you give back to our country. That’s why I am so concerned with the Republican tax cut that just passed because it helped those billionaires a whole lot more than it helped people that are just trying get by to put their kids in school, and to really pursue the American dream. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for a fair country and an even playing field. My grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines in Ely, Minn. He never got to graduate from high school because he had to go to work, and he saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to college, community college, then University of Minnesota, and my mom it was basically the same thing. That’s why you can have billionaires, but they should be giving back, and we should have policies to make sure we let everyone succeed.","Sure, if you earn it fairly. We live in a country that is founded on the principle of equal opportunity. We are not a country of equal results. There’s competition, free market competition, some people will do better than others. We just have to make sure opportunity truly is fair and equal. And then if you can be successful, then good for you.","That’s a good question. I don’t know that anyone deserves to have a billion dollars. I think we have a concentration of wealth, and power and privilege in this country that we haven’t seen since the last Gilded Age. And that concentration of wealth and power works counter to our democracy. So, both from a perspective of making sure that we have the resources to invest in people and communities, so that everyone is educated enough and well enough, and able to participate in economic life in this country, and to ensure that everyone sees a future for themselves, and there are not some who have better access to our democracy, to shaping the direction of this country, to guiding the course of this nation. It’s very important that we break down that concentration, and ensure that we have a greater level of equality in the United States.","Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. That’s a high-class luxury. I think they should certainly pay more in taxes if they are making that level of money given all of the investments and debts and things we need to do. But I also believe that we shouldn’t ask anybody for more money, whether they’re a middle class person or a billionaire, if we’re going to dump it into a bunch of broken systems that we have today, like broken healthcare system, broken criminal justice system, broken education system, broken immigration system, broken agriculture system, broken food system. I think we need to reform the government, and then ask those people to pay more into the new systems that we’re reforming so that we’re not wasting all of the money that we’re wasting today. But I have no problem asking them for more.","In America today we have grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality. Tonight you’re going to have some 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got about half of the people in this country living paycheck to paycheck. So, we need a economic system, and we need a tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. My guess is when you have that you’re not going to have too many billionaires left.","Sure, this is America. If you work hard, this should be a country where your potential is limitless. However, my problem is that it’s a top-floor economy, and success is more and more confined just to the top floors, and we have a tax system that reinforces that. So I want it to be a country where anyone who works hard can see that add up to something. And for some people, if it’s an idea good enough or if work hard enough, sure I still don’t mind someone being a billionaire.","In a world where kids are not getting opportunities, where schools have tiles that are falling down and teachers that are underpaid. When kids are struggling with a trillion and a half dollars in student loan debt, then I got a lot of problems with billionaires who are not paying a fair share. But, look at it the other way. In a world where every kid gets an opportunity, where schools are really good for all our kids, where we don’t crush people on student loan debt, where wages are going up across the economy, where when companies do better, their employees do better. In that world, we can have billionaires and it’s great and we can celebrate. It’s really about whether or not growth and prosperity in this country just all goes to the top — and that’s what creates billionaires. Or, whether or not growth and prosperity is something that everybody gets a chance to participate in. REPORTER: So that’s a nuanced answer. WARREN: I know it is, but it’s a true answer. And that’s the best I can do. This is because it’s a question that isn’t meaningful outside its moorings. It’s a question that takes its context. So I know it’s a long and complicated answer, but I think it’s the right answer.","Yes, there are people who deserve to have a billion dollars. I do believe that there is such a thing as righteous commerce. The problem is not that some people in America are rich. The problem in America is that not enough people can get rich. The problem is not just the accumulation of wealth. The problem is that we have a government that now passes policies that make it easier for those who already have a lot of money to get richer, and for those who don’t have much money even to thrive. So, that’s the problem. But some people have made a billion dollars in righteous ways, and good on them. I think they should pay more in taxes, for sure, but I have no problem with the idea that they deserve to have it, if in fact they made it righteously.","Well, deserve is a freighted word. Our economic system is designed so that billionaires would be a very natural byproduct. We have this winner take all economy, where you’d expect a number of billionaires and that’s what we have. Whether someone deserves it, that suggests that there is some sort of moral weighting scale, where one person deserves it, other people don’t deserve it. And I’m sure even most billionaires don’t think that they’re somehow 10,000 times more worthy than the average person. If you have to ask if it was just a yes or no question, like do I think that there’s something intrinsically wrong there being billionaires in the world, no, I do not."
