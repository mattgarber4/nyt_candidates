"1","11"," Do you think President Trump has committed crimes in office?","It looks to me like President Trump’s committed crimes in office. I think, It’s pretty clear that he has tried to obstruct the Mueller investigation.","I believe the president has committed impeachable offenses. And I think there needs to be a congressional investigation to draw out the facts. I believe, ultimately, there’s a very good chance he will be impeached. But I also say that we should keep our focus and our national discourse not just on one person and not just on the political life inside Washington D.C., but also on the bigger issues affecting working Americans. Sometimes I turn on the TV and it makes me angry that all I hear about is politics and process, and not about everyday people. So, you know, you don’t hear health care being talked about, you don’t hear people’s real wages being talked about. You don’t hear how many hours people are working being talked about. There’s something wrong when our national discourse is too much about the legislative maneuvering and the parliamentary maneuvering inside Washington, D.C. So, yeah, I think we have a president who has committed serious crimes and I think it will catch up with him. But I also think our national discussion has to be, first and foremost, about American people on the ground, in all 50 states, and the lives they’re living. And I don’t think that’s happening right now.","I think that if you read the Mueller report, and with any objective eye, it is deeply disturbing and alarming that you have a president in his campaign that made dozens of contacts with a foreign adversary, and where I’ve heard people on both sides of the aisle say they should have reported that behavior immediately. Or those — that outreach that was done to the campaign immediately to the F.B.I. This was a campaign that embraced those contacts, that sought to benefit from illegally obtained information. That is wrong and then they lied about it, tried to cover it up. And then you have a president in office, if you read the Mueller report, that it’s a report about lies and deceptions, with a president doing things that Mueller thought could be amounting to obstruction of justice. And again, you see a president, in the most deceitful ways, trying to lie. Even ordering top aides to try to manufacture evidence to potentially obscure criminal behavior. This is a problematic report. It should — everyone should find it objectionable on moral vandalism on the values of the nation, and what should be the conduct of a president of the United States. Now, I think Congress needs to continue that investigation. They should get an unredacted Mueller report. They should have Mueller come before Congress in open hearings. They should get the supporting documentation and continue the evaluation to see what the nature of the conduct, what doesn’t amount to criminal activity, and should the president or should he not be impeached.","I think that President Trump has normalized behavior that we’ve never accepted. The notion that two a half years in, you know, over 10,000 misleading or false statements. What we used to expect out of our president and our elected officials is substantially changing. I can’t say that, you know — I haven’t seen either the full Mueller report or others, that crimes per se — but I think we can all expect a lot more out of our leaders.","There’s evidence that the president has directed people to lie to Congress. There’s evidence that the president has, at best, taken legally questionable action when it comes to sending hush money that might amount to a campaign contribution. There is an atmosphere of illegality and corruption around this president that has, of course, led to a number of prison terms, indictments and guilty pleas for his associates. Rather than defending himself, he’s basically asserted that, by definition, a president can’t be held accountable for this kind of misconduct. All the more reason why we need to be defending the rule of law in this country, because I think a full investigative process would bear this out, according to the principles of justice. But those principles are being obstructed by this White House.","We’re going to find out. This president has done a number of things that are unprecedented, at least in the last, I don’t know, hundred years. We still need to see the Mueller report. We need to understand what investigations in the House Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Southern District of New York are going to find about the president and his associates. In some ways the Mueller report was not the end of the story. It is really just part of the beginning.","I do, I think he’s violated the Emoluments Clause. Because I think it’s pretty clear to me, even though that’s somewhat of an obscure provision, I think what he’s doing with the Trump Hotel in Washington D.C. is a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which is why I’m a plaintiff on the lawsuit suing him for that. So, I think the president has conducted himself in a way where he has been lawless with respect to that. I think there’s a lot of other things he’s done that makes him unfit to be the president of the United States: How he conducts himself, how he questions the norms in our society, how he attacks the separation of powers, which is what I think he just did with his declaration of national emergency. I mean, the Congress just did his job pursuant to Article 1 of the Constitution, it actually debated border security and it funded it, and the president didn’t like that outcome so he called a national emergency. I think that’s a direct attack on the separation of powers and is in many ways, unconstitutional. I think the fact that the president has in many ways, sided with foreign adversaries over our own intelligence community, I think is, you know, a terrible signal to the intelligence community of the United States. But in terms of your specific question, do I think he’s broken the laws? I think he’s violated the Emoluments Clause, which is a violation of laws, yes.","I think that Congress is exercising its oversight in duties over this administration and will continue to do so. I think that the Mueller investigation, which I supported, set out to see if there was any collusion between President Trump and the Russian government. That report came back showing there was no collusion. I think it’s important for us to move forward in this country, come together to solve real problems and to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. REPORTER: Are there any other acts he’s taken, perhaps not related to the Mueller investigation or to Russia, that strike you as potentially — GABBARD: Perhaps that could be true and I think Congress is continuing its oversight duties to pursue those investigations.","I don’t know and I think it’s urgent that we receive the full Mueller report. Having a four-page summary of 300-page report is highly inadequate and we don’t know what is actually happening right now with regard to that investigation. What Mueller did not opine on is whether or not there was obstruction of justice, and was unwilling to reach a conclusion. I’d like to see the full report.","I don’t know. I would love to see the Mueller report and maybe we can talk about it after that. REPORTER: O.K. Do you think he will? HARRIS: Do I — I hope so. I absolutely believe that the Mueller report should be made public. We need transparency. The American people have a desire to know what happened and they have a right to know what happened. And Bob Mueller spent, with his team of some of the best professionals in the business, they spent two years — probably around the clock — working on gathering evidence and information that the American public should have access to. And certainly the United States Congress should in its capacity of oversight.","We don’t have all the information yet. Certainly, there’s a lot of evidence and discussion that he might have, but I am a believer that we have to support the process and the investigations that are underway and, you know, not make decisions before all the information is available. REPORTER: Does that mean waiting for Mueller or does that just mean waiting for — HICKENLOOPER: It’s not just Mueller. There are a whole number of investigations. Now, if the Mueller investigation comes forward and they have evidence that there really was collusion with foreign countries, obstruction of justice, you can have a list of all the allegations, then I think that we should proceed with charges. That being said, we need to get that information and make sure that from all the various investigations, and I think they’re more investigations still to come, let’s make sure we get the facts.","I think it is likely that Donald Trump has committed crimes in office, and that’s where I believe impeachment must remain on the table, and it is edging closer to the plate right now. And I’m proud that the Democratic party is insisting to get to the bottom of this, and the truth. Because we have to maintain democracy and its fundamentals, and I’m glad that we have a party that’s committed to that right now in the U.S. Congress.","I think he may well have committed crimes in office, and that is why he must be held accountable, and that is why we must call Director Mueller before the Congress to testify. I think that he has to testify before the House and the Senate, and explain and answer our questions. We had Attorney General Barr before us. Attorney General Barr many times said he didn’t know the answers to questions, and he actually told me that he didn’t know whether or not Director Mueller had reviewed the taxes and financial documents of the president. He specifically told me to ask Director Mueller. Well, I can’t ask Director Mueller if they won’t allow him to testify. A foreign power invaded our democracy. They didn’t do it with tanks or missiles, but they did it with a cyberattack. And every American should want to have the answers. That is why we need to have Director Mueller, Counsel McGahn and get the answers, and go forward, and the White House has to stop stonewalling. The other thing I would add is the obstruction of justice claims where I questioned Director Barr. And I would like to question Director Mueller at length. When you have the man in the highest office of the land, the president of the United States, who is basically making statements about family members of a witness committing crimes, to me that looks like obstruction of justice, and you’ve had hundreds of former law enforcement officials — U.S. attorneys, former U.S. attorneys, Democrat and Republican-appointed, say the same thing. This administration must be held accountable. That’s why they must answer the subpoenas and answer our questions.","Yes I do. And I voted, over a year ago, to start a debate on impeachment in the House. You know, the Congress does two things: We debate things and we vote on them. I don’t think the time is right to vote on impeachment. We don’t have all the facts yet. We don’t have all the evidence. But I think the party made a mistake to wait until now to start talking about this as a debate. We should have started this a long time ago. There’s ample evidence that the president has committed crimes or is certainly, you know, clearly accused of committing crimes that we need to investigate. That’s our constitutional responsibility in the Congress and we shouldn’t have waited until now. REPORTER: Which crimes are you referring to? MOULTON: Well look, I mean there’s obstruction of justice crimes, obviously in the Mueller report, but dating back before then there’s a whole Emoluments Clause — ways that he’s abusing the office. There are election fraud issues that have come to light. There are a lot of things the president has done that are against our laws, against our constitution and he should be held accountable to the laws that the rest of us have to abide by as well.","I believe President Trump has committed crimes while in office. From my reading of the Mueller report, and from listening to his statement during his press conference, it is clear that he felt that he did not have the authority to bring criminal charges, but felt that it was important that Congress, which can under the Constitution do this through impeachment proceedings, begin that process. Failing to do that creates a culture of impunity, and a precedent that some people in this country, because of the position that they hold, are above the law. And in the world’s greatest democracy, that precedent cannot stand. So as politically difficult as it is to confront this for some, we must for the future of this country and for the future of our democracy.","Oh, I don’t think that there’s any question that he obstructed justice. You know, you don’t have to be a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out that when your own legal counsel tells you not to talk to Jeff Sessions because it will be obstruction of justice. And a few days later, you pull him aside at Mar-a-Lago and have conversations with him about the very topic they didn’t want you talking to him about, that it is a crime.","Well, I think that is exactly what the House Judiciary Committee is looking at. I believe this president, Mr. Trump, believes himself to be above the law. I think he is contemptuous of the Constitution, contemptuous of the separation of powers and I support an impeachment inquiry in the House to determine, in fact, whether his offenses are impeachable. But I am also concerned and believe that if we go down that road at the same time we cannot ignore the needs of working families in this country. It’s difficult and Nancy Pelosi finds herself in a very unenviable position of trying to hold Trump accountable, while at the same time addressing the needs of working Americans in terms of health care, in terms of the cost of prescription drugs, in terms of climate change, in terms of immigration reform and many of the major issues that we face.","I think it’s very likely that President Trump has sealed indictments waiting for him, based on testimony that I’ve heard, both in an open hearing, but also in some of the other hearings that we heard. And that is unsettling to hear. And what we have to do now in Congress is figure out how we hold him accountable because what we do next will not only make sure that it checks an out of control, abusive executive, but also, it sets the standard for future presidents.","So, I read the Mueller Report. I started on the day it came out and thought, well, I’ll just get into this a little bit and read into the evening, into the wee hours of the morning. Got up the next morning and finished it off — 448 pages. And when you get to the end, there are three things that are absolutely beyond The first is that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election system for the purpose of helping Donald Trump. The second is Donald Trump, as a candidate, welcomed that help. And the third is that when the federal government tried to investigate the first two things, Donald Trump did everything he could to delay, stop, move, shift over that investigation. And now more than 600 federal prosecutors have said, if he were anyone other than the president of the United States, he would be indicted and brought to trial, that these are criminal offenses. Instead, what Mueller did is he said, under the rules of the Trump administration, a sitting president cannot be indicted so he served it up on a silver platter to the Congress and said in effect, “Congress, this one is for you to deal with.” Congress has one tool, and that’s the tool of impeachment. I don’t know how anybody reads the 448 pages of the Mueller report and arrives at any conclusion other than we need to start impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. And let me just say on this, this is not politics. This is a matter of the relationship between the president of the United States and the Congress. It’s a matter of protecting the Constitution of the United States. We don’t have a government that says, “Hey, listen. If the president gets in trouble, circle the wagons and no matter what, protect the guy at the top.” That’s how dictatorships run. That’s how monarchies run. That’s how autocracies run. But it’s not how our democracy runs. Our democracy says there are checks and balances, and nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law. It is absolutely critical that we start these impeachment proceedings as a way for Congress to say that this president cannot obstruct justice and neither can the next president or the one after that or the one after that or the one after that. I know that some people think this would be politically inconvenient, but there’s no political inconvenience exception to the Constitution of the United States. This is a point of principle about our future as a democracy.","until proven guilty, and therefore, I would not say that the president has committed crimes, such for instance as obstruction of justice. Does it seem to me that there is a very good case for the obstruction of justice? Absolutely. Does it seem to me that there’s a very, very good case for other crimes as well — certainly for indictment? Absolutely. But until someone is convicted in this country, they are considered innocent. But I will tell you this: There have been moral crimes. There have been spiritual crimes against the principles on which this country purports to stand. And that alone, to me, is a reason for him not to be re-elected. It is a pillar of American jurisprudence that someone is considered innocent","No. I think that it’s for Congress, and to some extent the American people, to determine whether Donald Trump committed crimes in office. I’m laser focused on solving the problems that got Donald Trump into the White House in the first place. REPORTER: So you don’t think he committed crimes in office? YANG: I don’t think it’s my job to determine whether he committed crimes. I think it’s Congress’s job since they are the ones who are in position to either impeach him or not."
