"1","12"," Do you support or oppose the death penalty?","I oppose the death penalty because I think, in part, it’s part of our broken system of mass incarceration that is not administered in a way that is equal, just or fair.","I’ve always opposed the death penalty. I don’t think our governments, historically, have been able to get to the truth consistently enough to have the right to take someone’s life. I believe that there are many serious offenses that deserve a long time in prison, even life in prison, but I don’t believe in the death penalty. There’s been too many times where we’ve found out, later on, that someone was innocent. And the government took away their life. That goes against all my values. So I believe, at this point in our history, we’ve learned the lesson the hard way. We’ve seen a lot of families suffer unjustly, and I don’t believe in the death penalty as a moral question, and I don’t believe it’s a deterrent, the way it was often made out to be. I think it’s something that should be a part of our past.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: And why? BOOKER: You know, all my life, growing up, I saw that we had a criminal justice system that was deeply biased against people who are low-income, biased against people with mental illness. We have a nation that’s biased against folks in a way that, as Bryan Stevenson says, that treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent. The death penalty reflects many of those deep biases in our country, and there’s a level of finality to it, that we know already that people have been sentenced to death and mistakes have been made. I cannot support a system that has shown deep, deep bias, a system that has shown deep failings, a system that is so final. I do not believe our state should be involved in killing its own people in a way that violates our principles and values. We can have justice without putting people to death. This is something I have been writing reports against since I was a kid in grade school, and I just do not believe in the death penalty. Our nation can do better in pursuit of justice for all and supporting victims of violence, as well as supporting the communities, so that violence doesn’t happen in the first place.","I support it in limited circumstances. I have been attorney general and governor in Montana, and during that time, never once — and Montana has the death penalty — never once has the death penalty been imposed or carried out. I think that there are both significant economic and racial disparities when it comes to the death penalty, but I wouldn’t take it off the table for the most extreme circumstances, like terrorism.","I oppose the death penalty. I don’t think it makes us safer, and the inequities by which it’s been applied in this country are extremely disturbing.","I oppose the death penalty. I believe that it’s morally wrong to take somebody’s life. More than that, that the death penalty has been used disproportionally against poor people, against communities of color. That we have seen plenty of examples, over time, of people who were put on death row, and then they have been exonerated. There have been some cases where people believe that, although it’s never been conclusively proven, that an innocent person may have been put to death. So, I’m against the death penalty.","I oppose the death penalty. As a matter of policy. REPORTER: What do you mean by as a matter of policy? Versus personal — DELANEY: I oppose it personally. It’s always in some ways a difficult question, because if something were to happen to someone who you really loved, your emotional response, I’m sure mine would, too, would be that the death penalty is appropriate. But as someone who wants a more civil society and someone who wants a society that advances, as it relates to how we think about human life and human dignity, I don’t see myself supporting the death penalty. I don’t think it accomplishes anything, and I think we can do better than that.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: And why? GABBARD: Unfortunately we still have a broken criminal justice system that wrongly convicts innocent people, issuing them the death penalty. Even one of those wrong convictions, taking an innocent life, is wrong.","I oppose the death penalty. I think the way it is implemented in America today is racist, and I believe our criminal justice system has serious issues with regard to institutional racism that must be addressed. And one of the things we can do is eliminate the death penalty nationwide, but also we should get rid of the cash bail system. We should deal with harsh drug penalties, and fully legalize and decriminalize marijuana, and look at some of the punishments retroactively. So there’s a lot of work that needs to be done in addressing some of the real injustices in our criminal justice system today.","I’m personally opposed to the death penalty. I always have been. And for many good reasons, including how it has been applied, which has been to really do it in a way that has not been in favor of — and has been against, actually — people of color, African-American men in particular, Latino men, poor people. It does not provide a deterrent. It is a policy that is about a final sentence, which is death, even though DNA has proven that there have been people sentenced to death who in fact were not guilty. So I do not support the death penalty for a variety of reasons.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: And why? HICKENLOOPER: The death penalty costs, in Colorado, it’s $14 million to $16 million per case. It’s random. So, depending on which district attorney is looking at how they’re going to try your individual crime, you’ll get the death penalty or not. It seems to have a great deal of bias in that decision. It drags. You go through a decade, maybe two decades of appeals, and it drives the family members of the victims of the crime through the worst experience of their lives again and again and again. And there is no evidence — I found no study that demonstrates that it is a deterrent. Those states that got rid of the death penalty decades ago don’t have any more crime or violent crime than those states that have a frequent use of capital punishment. To me, it’s a clear reason. Again, this was as I got new information and understood this, it became apparent why so many countries in the world have abandoned the death penalty. It’s really, in the modern world, not workable.","I oppose the death penalty. We’ve essentially eliminated it under my leadership, and I look forward to many more things we need to end racial disparity in the criminal justice system, as infected the implementation of the death penalty. It is why I’ve offered pardons to thousands of people in the state of Washington, for those who’ve been caught in the drug wars for misdemeanor convictions of marijuana. We need reformation of our judicial system to remove the long shadow of racial disparity in that system.","I oppose the death penalty, and I have long held that view. I held that view when I was the chief prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county. I believe we need to reduce crime. And when you look at the facts on the death penalty, you see that states that have the death penalty actually don’t have lower crime rates than states that have it, so that’s the first common-sense answer. The second: It’s more expensive when you have the death penalty than it is simply keeping people in prison who are dangerous, dangerous criminals for the rest of their life. And this is because of the cost of appeals and other things. The third thing, which is key, is there is already racial injustice in our criminal justice system. We know that. Well, the ultimate racial injustice is if you have a death penalty, where we know, from study after study, that the results of whether a jury is going to come out and vote for a death penalty and give a prisoner that sentence, that depends on the race of the victim, and also, the race of the defendant. So for those reasons, I am opposed to the death penalty.","I oppose the death penalty. Flat out. REPORTER: Do you want to say why? MOULTON: I oppose the death penalty because you cannot afford to make a mistake. And sadly, we know, through the amazing work done by people at the Equal Justice Project and other places, that mistakes have been made in the past, that the death penalty has been unfairly applied, even putting innocent people to death. And one innocent person put to death is not worth it. So, I’m flat-out opposed. It’s a moral issue for me.","I oppose the death penalty. Neither the federal government nor the governments of the states should be in the process of taking the lives of our fellow Americans.","I oppose the death penalty. I think it is unevenly applied. We have innocent people in the United States who have been killed by the state for crimes that they did not commit. Until that system is fixed, we should not be applying it to anybody, maybe save a terrorist that would go through a certain proceeding. But other than that, an American citizen right now ... it’s not fairly applied. I think we should have a moratorium on it.","I’ve always opposed the death penalty. When we talk about the need for real criminal justice reform and ending the absurdity of the United States having more people in jail than any other country, part of the need for real criminal justice reform is for the United States to do what virtually every other major country on earth is doing. And that is not to participate in murder itself. The state should not be involved in murdering. You have people who’ve committed horrific crimes, people who are dangerous, people who should spend the rest of their lives behind bars, but I do not believe in capital punishment.","I oppose the death penalty. For seven years, I worked as a prosecutor, and I sent some of the worst people away for life without a chance of parole. That’s what I believe is the best sentence for anyone who carries out the worst crimes in our communities, but I do not support the death penalty.","I oppose the death penalty. And I oppose it on two grounds. One is that we’re not infallible as human beings. We make mistakes. And, particularly, the evidence suggests that we make mistakes that are racially tinged. We can’t do that as a country. I also oppose it because I think that people who have committed truly heinous crimes should die in prison. I think that is how we give them the maximum, maximum punishment that we can: keep them in prison for all of their days.","I oppose the death penalty. REPORTER: Do you want to elaborate at all?","I oppose the death penalty. It’s incredibly costly. We’ve made tragic errors in our past and likely will continue to do so, and our application of the death penalty is racist in many situations. And so, I would do away with the death penalty."
