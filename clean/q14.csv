"1","14"," Are you open to expanding the size of the Supreme Court?","I don’t think the American people have been prepared to expand the Supreme Court. I think it would meet with the same fate as when Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court.","I am not. I do not think expanding the Supreme Court makes sense, and I’ll tell you why: because of history. I admire so greatly Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but he tried it and it backfired in so many ways. I think there’s some things, we have to say are set, and then we have to work politically to make the changes we need. I think at this point in history, the best way to change America is through the electoral process, and that will very rapidly change our judiciary on many levels. It will take longer with the Supreme Court. But I worry that we end up in a kind of arms race if one administration increases the size of the court for their ends and then another party comes into power and increases it again. I don’t find that good for the country.","I worry about people that want to rush to expanding the Supreme Court, because I worry, where does that stop? It’s a race to the bottom. Does the Democratic Party get the kind of alignment of power in order to do that and expand it by a couple of justices, and then the Republican Party comes, and when they have an alignment of power, they do the same thing. And then one day my grandchildren will be asking me, “Hey, grandad, why is there 101 justices on the Supreme Court?” I want to you to know right now, I feel like the Republican Party and the Senate has done awful things that have abused constitutional intention, like denying President Obama in his final year what the Constitution says we should’ve done, which is hold hearings and advise and consent to a Supreme Court nominee. But I’m not sure if the cure to that is expanding the Supreme Court in a way that will be a race to the bottom. I think there’s things we need to do to begin to repair our democratic systems, so that they’re just and fair. And I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that we have people on the court that are not extremists, but that are going to return balance to our justice system.","I’ve actually argued in front of the Supreme Court. When I was there, and today, I’d love to think that it is a nonpolitical organization or entity. And when you saw what Mitch Mcconnell did with Merrick Garland — and we literally had an opening for a year — the idea that politics hasn’t played a role in this, I don’t think most Americans can believe anymore. So I am open to trying to say, how can we actually make sure that that court isn’t reflective of politics, it’s actually doing its job as the third branch of government. And expanding the court might be one way. REPORTER: Sounds like you are open to it then? BULLOCK: I’m open to making sure that, well, either be an expansion or other ways that we could turn around and try to get the politics out of the court.","I believe we need to reform the Supreme Court, but it’s not just about the number of justices. For example, when I’ve talked about having perhaps 15 members — an idea that will be floated in the Yale Law Journal soon — it’s not just about the number, but the makeup of the court. If we were to have 15, in a structure where five of them were chosen not through a political process, but by a unanimous consensus among the other 10, we might be able to reduce the politicization of the court. There are other reforms being talked about that could deliver a similar result. The point is not how many justices run the court. The point is not even how far to the right or left it is — though I do believe it’s become far too conservative for the American people. The point is, how do we change the trajectory of the court away from being viewed as an increasingly political institution? We can’t have an apocalyptic ideological firefight every time there’s a vacancy. And I think reform needs to be achieved in fairly short order, and in order for us to save the court that we need so much in terms of institutional credibility to keep our republic in good shape.","I don’t believe that expanding the size of the Supreme Court is the answer. And one of the reasons for that is that if Democrats go and expand the size of the Supreme Court tomorrow, what’s to say that five years from now, that Republicans won’t expand the size of the Supreme Court again to gain a partisan advantage? I’m more interested in proposals that have suggested, for instance, term limits on justices. If you set those terms at 18, 20, 24 years instead of a lifetime appointment. There have been other suggestions, for instance, that Democrats make a certain number of appointments, and Republicans make a certain number of appointments, and then some appointments are somehow jointly made. To me, those kinds of proposals are more interesting — and I think, more likely to be fruitful if we did implement them — than just increasing the number of Supreme Court justices.","I would be open to giving Merrick Garland a seat, because I think what happened to him was terrible. I think what Mitch McConnell did was unpatriotic, and in many ways an attack on the Constitution, so I’m emotionally supportive of something like that. But at the end of the day, I think that we have to support the norms of our society. And if we grow the Supreme Court during my presidency, if Congress decides to do that and grow the Supreme Court for political reasons, then we just have to expect that that’ll happen when the Republicans are in power. So, I don’t favor doing things that really are against the norms in our society just for short-term political reasons.","I don’t think that expanding the size of the Supreme Court solves the problem that we’re facing, where the court has increasingly become a partisan political entity. Even if you add more numbers to the Supreme Court, you’re still not going to solve the problem: how, unfortunately, those who are appointed are largely appointed on partisan reasons rather than making sure Supreme Court justices are chosen based on their commitment to upholding and defending our Constitution.","Expanding the size of the Supreme Court is something I am thinking about right now. I haven’t thought through all the impacts of that. I understand why advocates want to do that, because they feel like the Gorsuch seat was stolen from President Obama because he was not actually allowed to have a vote on his nominee, or even a hearing. So I understand people’s concerns, but I want to think more about it and do more research about what legal scholars believe the impact of that would be.","leave it there? HARRIS: No, just, I’m open to it. I’m absolutely open to it. I am open to that discussion. REPORTER: Do you want to elaborate on that, or","The discussion has been expanding the size. We’ve had the size of the Supreme Court for a long time, and expanding the size of it, I think, would require a national discussion, comprehensive in scope, and I think would have to be done in a way that balances our historical reliance on the system we have now. REPORTER: So maybe open but not very open? HICKENLOOPER: Yeah. I’m open to it, but again, the founding fathers put this country together. We created a Constitution and Bill of Rights and a system by which we manage our democracy. And if we’re going to change significant parts of that, we should do so carefully.","I’m open to any idea that can make sure a woman’s right of choice is protected, including a civil rights law by statute that would protect a woman’s right of choice. And I think that we should start by making sure that we do not allow the depredation of the theft of a Supreme Court seat which occurred. Which, by the way was not a theft from the Democratic Party, it was a theft from the American people. And as a person who potentially could make appointments, you could count on me to follow those tenets. REPORTER: Sounds like that’s a yes? INSLEE: I’m open to various ideas; I have not centered on any one. There are some new ideas about the potential of having court of appeals judges participate on the Supreme Court. I think these are worthy of consideration. But let’s not lose focus. The first thing we need to do is to get a new president and new senators that will not allow further theft for the American people of seats, and further appointments that jeopardize a woman’s right of choice, which is now under attack. And I’ve stood strong against the attacks on women since I first went to the legislature in a very Republican district in 1988. And I’ll continue to guard jealously that right.","I am open to it. It depends on what happens with the Senate, if that’s realistic. I think my much more practical focus will be on immediately, when I become president, filling open judgeships with people who actually have said they will follow existing precedent and follow the law. We have seen the Republicans marching through judicial openings, and I know that there were some delays when President Obama came in, in getting some of those seats filled. I lived it, I saw it, and I won’t let that happen when I’m president.","I am open to that. The fact of the matter is that the Republicans have played hardball with us, and we haven’t played hardball in return. I don’t know if the goal at the end of the day should be expanding the size of the Supreme Court, but we absolutely have to have that on the table. With what the Republicans did with Merrick Garland, they’ll try anything, they’ll do anything. And we’ve got to show that we’re willing to do the same.","I don’t know that expanding the size of the Supreme Court is the best way to address legitimate concerns we have with its objectivity, given the issues that it will decide. Whether it’s the future of women’s reproductive freedom, whether it’s corporate personhood, whether it is large donors, and corporate donors, and special interest donors in our democracy. I think the appropriate way to address this is to have fixed term limits for Supreme Court justices, to have some more regular turnover in their term of service, to decrease the temperature in the partisan fights that lead up to the nominations in confirmations. I think that’s the best path we can take as a country.","No. No, I think the Supreme Court should stay at nine. REPORTER: Why? RYAN: First and foremost, it’s really not even in the realm of possibility to get it changed. And I’m trying in this election to stay away from discussions that aren’t directly impacting, in the short-term, the lives of people who are struggling economically and trying to make ends meet. And to think that we’re going to be able to change the size of the Supreme Court, or get rid of the Electoral College, or any of these other issues, I think is moving us away from the real arguments that can help us win the elections that we need to win and win the election that is coming up in 2020.","I think Roosevelt tried that in the 1930s, didn’t work so well for him. Packing the courts is a great idea when you’re in power, not such a great idea when your political opponents are in power. So, if you go from nine to 13, and go 13 from seven, to 17 — it never ends. But I am open to the idea of rotating judges out of the Supreme Court into courts of appeals, for example, to allow them to get a new look at the real world that is out there. But I am not in favor of packing the courts.","No. I want to win. The best way to get a court that’s fair and qualified — as we say in the Bay Area, “Just win, baby.” And I don’t want to use expanding the Supreme Court or getting rid of the Electoral College as an alibi for failing to go to places where we need to win. If we go and win in the South, if we win in the Midwest, we can have a court that reflects America’s values. And I’m committed, if I’m the nominee, to going across the country to help us win the Senate so we can do just that when I take office and appoint Supreme Court justices.","I’m open. REPORTER: Do you want to expand on that? WARREN: No. Actually, I mean, we could. Because the point is, there are a lot of different ways to do it. The number of people on the Supreme Court is not constitutionally constricted. But it’s one of the things that we could certainly talk about.","I’m not convinced that expanding the size of the Supreme Court is going to fix anything. Because I think that the same drama will play out. The same kinds of proportionality issues will play out. Also, another problem I have with the idea of expanding the Supreme Court is that, right now every time there is a nominee for the Supreme Court, the popular imagination is engaged. People know, “Wow, there’s a new Supreme Court nominee,” and we understand about the nine. If we have too many, I think it’ll be just like, “Oh, there’s a new Supreme Court nominee,” which seems to me even more dangerous. So, no, I’m for staying with it the way it is.","justices. And if you look at what’s happened with our Supreme Court, it’s become intensely politicized, but it’s also become a firestorm because of lifetime appointments, where right now we literally are anxious about the health of an 86-year-old justice because we think the law of the land may hang on the balance of her health. So the first thing we have to do is, we have to do away with lifetime appointments for Supreme Court justices. We have to make it 18-year appointments, which is still plenty long and enough to make you immune to political vacillations, but it’s not a lifetime appointment. I mean when the Constitution was written, our life expectancies were much shorter and Supreme Court justices regularly stepped down for any variety of reasons. It was not a situation where they were clinging to the court until they’re on death’s door because the law of the land depended on it. So it would make total sense to institute a term limit of 18 years, and it also would make total sense to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court, because then when someone stepped down it would become less of a political crisis or firestorm. Other societies have had supreme courts that have had significantly more justices than nine, and then when someone steps down or rotates off, it’s not as big a deal. So the answer is, yes, I would obviously consider having more justices on the Supreme Court. There is nothing in the Constitution that stipulates the number of Supreme Court"
