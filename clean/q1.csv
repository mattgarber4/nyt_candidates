"1","1"," In an ideal world, would anyone own handguns?","Yes, but in an ideal world, Donald Trump would not be our President.","In an ideal world anyone who owned a gun would know how to make sure they were safe and would use them responsibly. I believe in our Constitution, so I respect the Second Amendment, but we have to handle guns in an entirely different fashion in this country. And there’s such clear American majorities for things like background checks and ensuring that there are appropriate waiting periods and making sure that guns do not fall in the hands of people who are ready to do harm to themselves or others. So I believe in our Constitution, but I think, in the ideal world, gun ownership would be treated very, very differently.","You know, when people bring up gun violence in this country, it immediately becomes very personal to me, because I live in one of those communities that’s seen horrific realities of our children being killed at levels that are unconscionable. We have, in my short lifetime, more people that have died by gun violence than all the wars in America, from the Revolutionary until now, combined. We have a nation where it doesn’t even seem to notice anymore, the carnage that you see in communities across this country, like mine. I had a shooting just days ago in Newark, and a reporter who was there moments before, a block away, moments before the shooting texted me and said, “I can’t find any mention of it online.” And I got very angry and I said, “That’s because we live in a country right now that doesn’t even seem to take notice of inner city murders.” We need to change this uniquely American problem that we’re now seeing in every corner of our society, and what have we done? People die in synagogues, we do nothing. People die in churches, and we do nothing. People die at concerts, and we do nothing. And every day, 100 people die to gun violence and we do nothing. So, as president of the United States, I’m going to bring a fight to this problem like folks have never seen before, because I know the pain in communities like mine, the ripping of the fabric, the reverberating of the violence, the trauma that stays in communities that know gun violence, the lives that are destroyed. Enough is enough in our country. We will end this crisis by doing the kind of common-sense things that will make our nation safe, and this debate will not be dictated by the corporate gun lobby. It will be dictated by Americans that know we can do things that make our nation so much safer, so much stronger. Governments are formed for the defense of their people. It’s one of the fundamental things said in our founding documents, and we’re failing that call. I will step up to this challenge, and we will solve this problem.","Yes. I mean 40 percent of households have firearms in them. Every legal firearm owner that I know wants to keep themselves and their family safe and guns not falling into the wrong hands. So, I don’t think that in an ideal world, there are people that, all they do is target-shoot, all they do is hunt. That’s what I do. So, it’s not that we should deny them the right to have a firearm. What we do is, we need to make sure that our families and our communities are safe. Because I think the values are the same, non-firearm-owners and those that own firearms. They want to keep their family, their community and themselves safe. If we ever look at this as a public safety issue, instead of a political issue, I think that we could go a long ways.","Well, in an ideal world, nobody would feel the need. But I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the desire of people to have a means of self-defense, as long as there are common-sense measures, as we have around every American and every constitutional right, from freedom of speech, to freedom of religion, to make sure that it does not harm Americans. And that’s the debate that’s playing out right now when it comes to common-sense gun safety.","In an ideal world, people would not own handguns. And there are a number of countries around the world where people do not own handguns, where they’re not permitted. And we see that those countries have more safety, greater safety, less violent deaths and so forth. However, we also recognize in the United States that the Supreme Court in the Heller decision has ruled that people do have a right to bear arms. And so for the time being, what we need to do is make sure that we make the possession of firearms as reasonable as possible. I believe in common-sense gun reform, in limiting the capacity of magazines, in universal background checks, in a 21st-century updated assault weapons ban. But we also need to go further than that. We need to invest in things like gun buybacks. Because what we’re dealing with right now, what our attention has been focused on, largely, has been these mass shooter incidents. But really, if you look at it, that’s not the majority of the gun violence that happens in our country. We need things like gun buybacks. We need to roll back some of these laws around campus carry, for instance, that I believe make our public spaces more dangerous. And so, I would not only pursue what we often think of as common-sense gun reform, but I would also look at really addressing this issue in other, also effective ways.","Well, we don’t live in an ideal world. We live in a country where we have the Second Amendment, which I support. So that gives the American people the right to bear arms, and under the Second Amendment, they have the right to bear handguns. But, I do think that’s not an unlimited right. I think we can put in place common-sense gun safety provisions that involve things like universal background checks and the limitation on certain kind of high-powered military style weapons and things like red flag laws, but that’s the world we live in.","I support our Second Amendment rights, and people’s choice to whether or not they want to own handguns or not.","I’m not opposed to gun ownership. What I am opposed to is gun violence. And the reason why I’ve worked so hard to end gun violence is because I’ve met parents who have lost children, wives who have lost husbands, people who have lost the people they love the most. And I can tell you, the problem we have is an N.R.A. that is dominated by greed. The N.R.A. does not represent law-abiding gun owners anymore. They represent gun manufacturers. And because of their advocacy, they want to sell weapons to people on the terror watch list, who are gravely mentally ill with a violent background, and people with criminal records for violent crimes. Because that’s why they oppose a universal background check. They aren’t willing to ban bump stocks or large magazines, or assault rifles and assault weapons, and they’re not even willing to have a federal anti-gun-trafficking law. So I oppose the N.R.A.’s advocacy because it’s all dominated by gun sales. They care more about their profits than they care about people, and that is the definition of greed. So we need to hold the gun manufacturers accountable, and I think what the youth movement is doing today is extraordinary. I think advocates like Emma Gonzales are changing the narrative, and I want to lift up their voices to make sure that they are heard, to begin to shame members of Congress who will not hold the N.R.A. accountable and will not hold the gun manufacturers accountable.","In an ideal world, there would be no gun violence. And, listen, I support the Second Amendment, but we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, and the fact that United States Congress has failed to have the courage to reject a false choice, which suggest you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment, or you want to take everyone’s guns away, is irresponsible. It’s the height of irresponsibility. I strongly believe that supposed leaders need to have the courage to understand that we need to be practical on this. We need to pass smart gun safety laws, starting with universal background checks, and with a renewal of the assault weapons ban.","Well, in an ideal world, you could philosophize it that no one wants handguns. I think that the notion that so many people have that a handgun makes them safer, it’s a little bit like people’s health care insurance through their business. It is something that they accept and believe in. That being said, study after study after study shows that having a handgun, in most cases, makes you less safe, not more.","I think that in a world that I can foresee, that law enforcement personnel that are trained and are protecting us, certainly are going to be needed. And I do believe that there is some right, privately, for firearms. But I have been a person who cast one of the pivotal votes to pass the assault weapon bill in 1994. I lost my seat in part because of that, but I have never regretted that vote, because it was the right vote. And now I can tell you we’ve got the N.R.A. on the run in Washington State. We’ve passed three of the strongest gun safety laws in the United States, and we have more to do. So, I’m committed to common-sense gun safety, which ought to be a top priority for the United States, and I am proud to continue the work that we’ve done in Washington State to make that national. I believe we need to and can do that with the next president.","I have never come out for banning guns, but I think we have to do a much better job of getting guns out of the hands of people that shouldn’t have them. This is the issue of our time and the issue of this new generation. When I was in law enforcement, way back then, I was for an assault weapon ban. And police chiefs, district attorneys, we were unable to get that done. Then I got to the Senate. Sandy Hook happened, massacres happened, 30 kids a day getting killed when you look at a lot of the shootings across our country, every day, on the streets. And yet, we were not able to pass that universal background check bill that two A-rated N.R.A. senators put forth. That was a sad day, that the Senate didn’t have the courage to do it. But now, we have a new generation. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year olds, that’s the best thing that could ever happen. Since Parkland, kids across the country have been ignited on this issue. So as president, I will ensure that we get universal background checks done, that we get the boyfriend loophole fixed, if we don’t get it fixed, bump stock ban, you name it. I think we have to do a better job, not of banning guns — and I come from a state with a proud hunting tradition where, literally, I look at all these proposals, and I say, “Does this hurt my Uncle Dick in the deer stand?” None of these proposals I’ve discussed, including an assault weapon ban, does that. We need to get these bills done.","In an ideal world, we would not have weapons of war on our streets. That’s the bottom line. I’m someone who had to use guns. Every day in Iraq I walked around with an assault rifle and a handgun at the very least. And, so, I’ve seen the destruction that guns can cause. So, while I respect the Second Amendment, there’s no need for weapons of war on our streets or in our schools. I’ll use the credibility of someone who understands guns, who has used guns, someone who can even say “guns saved my life,” to fight to make our community safer. REPORTER: What about handguns, not a weapon that’s an exclusively military weapon? MOULTON: Well, I mean, look, that’s a discussion that we should have and a debate that we should have in the United States. I mean, the fact of the matter is that handguns cause a lot of deaths around the country. And we can have a good debate about whether they should be allowed to be free. But the easy ones are these assault rifles that are clearly weapons of war. Gosh, if you need an assault rifle to go hunting, then I think you need some hunting lessons. Assault rifles have been used to perpetrate some of the worst massacres of gun violence here at home and around the globe, and we should start with outlawing them.","I think in an ideal world, our country would do a much better job of protecting the lives of our fellow Americans. We would ensure that anyone who wants to buy a handgun, or any weapon, goes through an extensive background check, to prevent those who are a danger to themselves or to others from owning and using those weapons. I think in an ideal world, we would stop selling weapons of war into our communities, where they so often show up in our schools, in our concerts, in our churches, in our synagogues, in our public life. We would have red flag laws to ensure that those who own weapons and are a danger to someone in their lives, or to themselves, are stopped before it is too late. In an ideal world, we would listen to people instead of political action committees and the gun lobby and the N.R.A. And I think we can get closer to that ideal world in an administration that will listen to people and put their lives and concerns first.","I believe that law-abiding citizens do have the right to protect themselves. Some people that are law-abiding citizens, they live in tough neighborhoods, and there may be crime, and they want to protect their family. I believe they have the right to do that, if they’re not a criminal, if they’re not a terrorist, and they meet the standards that we set as a society, I believe people have the right to protect themselves.","Coming from a state where a whole lot of people own guns and people enjoy target-practicing and so forth, yeah, I think if used in a sportsman-type way — yeah, I think that would be acceptable. But, having said that, I mean, right now we’re looking at an epidemic of gun violence in this country. Some 40,000 people, many of them suicides, 40,000 deaths took place last year from guns. Clearly we need to deal with the epidemic of gun violence, and I very strongly believe that we have to go forward into what we call common-sense gun safety legislation, and that is extending background checks, it means doing away with the gun show loophole. It means basically making sure that people who should not own guns do not own guns. From way back when, I was someone who believed that automatic weapons — which, military-style weapons — should not be sold or distributed to the civilian population, and that’s my view today. I think we should ban the sale and distribution of automatic weapons.","I have no problem with people owning handguns. I want to make sure that we keep the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people. That means to me, background checks, that means banning and buying back 15 million assault rifles, weapons of war that have no business in our community, investing in gang violence prevention programs. But keep your pistols, keep your shotguns, keep your rifles. If you want to go hunt with your family, shoot for sport, or protect your house, that’s in our Constitution and you’re allowed to do that. I just happen to believe that this unrestricted weaponry that’s out there is making our kids less safe in their schools, and parishioners less safe in our churches and synagogues and mosques, and that we could do a lot more to make them safer.","Sure. There are people who own guns. I understand that. My family had guns when I was growing up. My brothers have guns. There are people who like to target-shoot and there are people who have guns for safety reasons. But, boy, we need to be a country that’s not held hostage by the N.R.A., and we need to have better gun safety laws in place, serious laws that protect us and protect our children. Statistically speaking, today, seven children will die from gun violence. And it will happen again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. Some of these will be mass shootings, but some will just be a kid on the sidewalk, a kid at the playground. If seven of our children were dying from some mysterious virus, boy, we’d be all over that. We’d be calling in the researchers and trying to figure out what we needed to change. We need to do the same with guns. We have a moral responsibility to protect our children and that starts with better gun safety laws.","I am not for messing with the Bill of Rights. And the Second Amendment is the right to bear arms. Now, as we know, of all the times of the founders have become unclear, that clause about for the purposes of a well-organized militia — I believe in strong, common-sense gun safety laws. There should be universal background checks. There should be outlawing of bump stocks. There should be no high-speed magazines. There should be no — I do not believe that military assault rifles should be available to the average person. And I am, even now, processing this issue of gun registration. But, no, I believe that we have the right to bear arms in the United States, and I am not arguing for the repeal of the Second Amendment.","I’m for gun safety. I think we should treat firearms the same way we treat motor vehicles, where if you have a motor vehicle and you use it poorly, you can kill someone, and so we have testing and licensing. And so we should be testing and licensing for firearms in the same way. And if you look at when someone buys a handgun, one of the most common victims of a crime will be the owner him- or herself, where often when people get depressed they will drink and then the handgun, if it’s there, ends up leading to tragedy. So in my ideal world, firearms would be much, much more judiciously owned and we would know what was happening when someone buys a gun, it’s not like you just walk in and pick one up on a lark. But the right to bear arms is in the Constitution and there are 300 million guns in the United States right now. We’re the most heavily armed society in the history of the world. So talking about a future where no one owns a handgun is, frankly, not going to match up with reality in any reasonable timeframe."
