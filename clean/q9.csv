"1","9"," Where would you go on your first international trip as president?","alliance is strong, that we care about NATO and we understand that it’s in our national security interest, as well as their national security interest, that we maintain the strong alliance that we have forged since World War II and that every president, until Donald Trump, has supported and endorsed. REPORTER: All over Europe, or a particular country? BENNET: No, I think, yeah — I think a lot of different places. I never thought about that. I probably would go to Europe to reassert that the","I think our alliances around the world have been frayed, so, first place I’d go is to the European Union to restore the alliances we used to have that were central to America’s strength in the world and America’s ability to protect itself. I think we’ve seen extraordinary rifts that used to not exist, because President Trump has been reckless. And we’ve got to remember that this is not a new normal we should accept: a president who attacks allied nations, attacks allied leaders, belittles folks who we need to be our friends. His attack on Mayor Sadiq Kahn of London really hit me personally. This is someone I value as a colleague and a friend. And Sadiq Kahn is an exemplary public servant and one of the great models to Muslims all over the world of the power of democracy to uplift people of all backgrounds. And to see President Trump attack him in just a belittling, demeaning way, was just one small example of a very destructive approach to foreign policy. So, the next president has to do a lot of cleaning up, a lot of repair, a lot of healing. I want to do that all over the world, but I’d start with our closest allies, who sure have felt like we have turned away from them in recent years. REPORTER: Any particular country you have in mind? DE BLASIO: I think it would be a group of them, but I can give you some if you want? REPORTER: Yes! DE BLASIO: O.K. I’d start with a trip to the European Union. To France, to Germany, to Great Britain, obviously — even though they’re in the middle of Brexit, they’re a crucial ally that we need to work with. We have to repair all of the rifts that Donald Trump created. And we have to show the people of those countries that we respect them, because they’ve sure been treated disrespectfully by our current president.","I’ve given a lot of thought to that, and it’s not something I’m going to be telling The New York Times about right now. I know you guys are trying to get a scoop, but I’ve thought a lot about that, and it is an important trip, both for substance as well as symbol, to talk about what my priorities are going to be. But one thing you should know when it comes to the international landscape, I have a number of priorities. Number one is the safety and security of the United States of America. And when I say safety and security, it’s not just about a strong military. It’s actually about having strong diplomacy, because I think that a lot of our military interventions have made the world less safe, as well as the United States less safe. It means rejoining our allies and affirming our alliances, not doing what we see now, which is bludgeoning them and weakening them. Because at the end of the day, America is the strongest nation on the planet Earth, but our strength is magnified and multiplied when we join with countries that share our values and share our sense of mission on the planet Earth for the affirmation of human rights, for the security and self-determination of people. My international agenda will be driven by American values, which are humanitarian values, which are led by democratic principles, which are understanding that we are one great nation in a planet that has many nations that need to work together in accord to achieve peace and security and human rights for all.","I think that the next president is going to have to build — rebuild — a lot of alliances that have been so important to America and global safety for decades. So I’d probably start by assuring some of our partners that we’re still that trusted friend. And that could be as close as Canada, it could be down to Mexico. It could be over to Europe as well. That’s what I’d like to do, and it’s not the first time that our country has had to kind of rebuild some of our strategic alliances, but it also may well depend on what the crisis at the moment is. REPORTER: So your first trip could be to Canada? BULLOCK: My first trip could well be to Canada. My first trip would be assuring our allies that the trusted partner that they’ve had for four decades will continue to be their partner.","that there are so many alliances that the United States needs to shore up, that I would begin by talking to some of our closest friends. REPORTER: Are there any particular countries you have in mind? BUTTIGIEG: I’m not sure I’ve picked out one country that ought to be visited first. We certainly have regional security interests everywhere in the world. But I’d be concerned about recalibrating the way we talk to our competitors, too. So you could expect vigorous engagement with China and Russia early in my term. Probably better become president before finalizing that decision, but I do think","My first international trip would be either to Mexico or to Canada, because those are our neighbors. They’re the most important allies we have. They’re the most impactful nations when it comes to our economics in the United States and of course our security. We need to repair some relationships after this administration, including with Mexico and Canada. I would also visit our European allies soon after my inauguration to repair the damage that this administration has done with a number of countries in Europe and to embrace again the alliances that have helped make the United States militarily stronger, safer and economically more prosperous over the last several generations.","I think we have a lot of shoring up to do with our allies. So, I think I would do a large tour touching base with some of our most important allies, both in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region. We’ve walked away, and sent very bad signals on a lot of the most important alliances we have in the world, whether it be tearing up the Paris accord or withdrawing from Paris, whether it be questioning NATO, whether it be tearing up the TPP. So, my first international trip will be focused on our alliances and focused on shoring up some of our most important alliances, because I think the portfolio of allies the United States of America has is maybe our most valuable foreign policy asset.","That’s a good question. I’ll get back to you on that. REPORTER: Any sort of general thoughts on what kind of place it might be or what you’d like to do with that trip? GABBARD: No. I think it’s important for us to look at the threats that we have to our national security and to make our decisions about foreign policy accordingly.","I think the next president really has to focus on bringing peace in the world. And, so, my first trip would be to the Middle East. REPORTER: Any specific country? GILLIBRAND: I would go to Israel, and I would travel throughout the Middle East and begin to have a worldwide conversation about what it takes to have peace. I think addressing what’s happening in Syria is an urgent issue right now, and I think making sure our allies know we are there for them. I would also engage with our NATO allies, and make sure they know we stand with them.","I think probably the first place I’d go is wherever — well, return to — wherever it is that we have American troops who are in the line of fire. I think it is critically important that a president of the United States have a full understanding of the conditions and the circumstances of any place where we send American lives to defend our values or our country. REPORTER: Do you think that practically means Afghanistan, or it could be anywhere? HARRIS: Well, we’ll see, because who knows what this president will do in the interim. REPORTER: That’s a little dark.","It depends on what the circumstances are at that moment. But, on a basic foundation, I would go first to our strongest allies. I’d want to go to NATO, to Europe, and reassure those allies who now are thinking, perhaps the United States is not the reliable ally that they’ve always believed. But then I would also reach out to the major influencers of the next century. By that I mean China, India, also Brazil and Turkey, some of these countries that are potentially our allies but would need to know that we are willing to be a partner and eager to help support them as they lift large portions of their populations out of poverty.","Don’t know the answer to that, but wherever it is, it will be a place where we build alliances rather than to break them down as Donald Trump has been. And when we build alliances, we are stronger rather than weaker, something that Donald Trump does not understand. So, I look forward to wherever that trip is, it’s going to reverse the course of chaos caused by Donald Trump in our international relationships. REPORTER: Do you have anywhere you’re thinking about, a couple places that you have your eye on? INSLEE: I think my first choice would be wherever we can reinvigorate the international effort to defeat the climate crisis. And whether that is Paris, to make sure we remain in the Paris Agreement, or another community to even build on that agreement, to be more ambitious and more aggressive, and to show American leadership to defeat climate crisis, that’s where I’ll go.","I would go to visit our allies. Right now, we have a situation where the president is dissing our allies or not standing with our allies. Look at how he withdrew from the international climate change agreement, from the Iran agreement to eliminate a nuclear capability in Iran. What I would do is, I would go to Canada, and I would go to visit our NATO allies, and I would assure them that America doesn’t stand alone in the world. We don’t coddle dictators. We stand with our allies.","I would go to some of our allies that President Trump has abandoned around the globe. You know, I’d start with some of our key old European allies that have always been important to us. I’d go to Canada and Mexico. I’d start with the allies that we have to keep close. My division motto in the Marine Corps was “no better friend, no worse enemy.” That should be the motto of the United States. But President Trump has done the exact opposite. He’s cozied up to our enemies and he’s abandoned our friends and allies across the globe.","I would go to Mexico, our most important neighbor, a potential ally as we address other significant challenges in the Western Hemisphere. If it is the out-migration from the Northern Triangle countries of Central America, if it is addressing the deep humanitarian concerns that we have in Venezuela, if it is making sure that we lead in concert with the other states of the Americas, that leadership begins with our relationship with Mexico. And it should be a relationship based on respect and trust and treating one another with dignity.","Europe. I would go to Europe. In fact, I already teased my wife that, within the first few weeks of getting sworn in, we’re going to have to go to Europe and really rebuild our alliances in NATO and make sure that our friends know that the United States is back, and we’re ready to take the responsibility of leading the world again. And I think that has to be the first trip. Maybe through Canada.","I have no idea. There are a lot of hot spots around the world. I think clearly we want to reaffirm our relationship with many of our traditional allies in Europe and elsewhere, relationships that Trump has certainly ruptured. And at the same time, we want to make sure we are sitting down with adversaries around the world. I will do everything I can as president to resolve international conflicts, not militarily but diplomatically. And that means reaching out both to our allies and to our adversaries.","My first international trip as president, I would go to Europe and reassure our NATO partners that we are still with them. The next president is going to have to take the oath, catch a plane, and go on a global affirmation tour. So, I would visit our NATO allies. I also would assure the South Koreans and the Japanese that we value the friendship and partnership we have there, because this president continues to threaten them that they should be paying us more for our presence in their countries. Our alliances are what reduce what we have to spend on national defense, they’re what keep us safe. I’m a parent of two kids, so I look at everything in parental metaphors. And if you were a citizen looking at our foreign policy landscape like a parent looks at a playground, you will have seen in the last three years that your child has gone from hanging out with the honor-roll kids — the French and the Brits and the Germans — to now, we roll with the detention crew — the Russians and the Turks and the Saudis. And it’s not just bad company; it costs us more if we can’t count on traditional allies, if we have to spend more at home, if we’re ripping up treaties that make us have to invest more in our national defense.","I think I’d go to Central America. I think I’d go down to where there are such terrible problems that cause people to flee, and to meet with people in that region and talk about how we can help them there, so that their lives are more secure and more stable. Can I have a second trip, though? REPORTER: You can have as many trips as you want. WARREN: Good. I’d probably go back to Afghanistan. I was there with John McCain, a year ago last summer. I think it was his last trip before he fell ill, and it was a moment to visit with our troops and visit with the Afghans on the ground and to learn how after — then — 16 years of American fighting in Afghanistan, that the Afghan government still only controlled about 60 percent of all the land; that it didn’t have the confidence of the people; that the opium trade was higher than ever; that the border with Pakistan was porous; that multiple terrorist groups had footholds throughout Afghanistan. To me, going to Afghanistan is a reminder of two things simultaneously. One is how our troops will do anything we ask them to do. All three of my brothers are veterans. These are people who will lay it all on the line. But the second is how careful we need to be in asking them to make that sacrifice — that we not only need to have a plan for how to get into a country; we need to have a plan for what constitutes success when we’re there and how to get back out. Staying for a hundred years is not a plan. Doing more of the same that’s not working, is not a plan. And Afghanistan is important for itself. We need to get out, but it’s also an important object lesson for how America needs to rethink every engagement going forward.","can tell you what my first international calls would be, and that is to the leaders of Europe to say, “We’re back, we’re back!” And also, I would call Jacinda Ardern — if that’s how you pronounce her name — who is the prime minister of New Zealand, because she has said that she wants New Zealand to be the country that is the best country in the world for a child to grow up. And I want to call her and say, “Girlfriend, you are on, because I want the United States to be that, too.” I don’t know where I would go on my first international trip as president, but I","It would depend upon what the circumstances were in the world, but I would let other leaders and other nations know that America is very eager to work with them to rebuild our partnerships and alliances, but I would want to know what was going on in 2021. It’s hard for me right now to say where I would go first. REPORTER: Is there any region of the world or country you’re eyeing? YANG: No. My first impulse is to go someplace that’s close to home. So, it would be someplace in South America, I would imagine."
