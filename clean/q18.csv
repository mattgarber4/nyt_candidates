"1","18"," Does anyone deserve to have a billion dollars?","People in a capitalist country are going to have a billion dollars, but we’ve got the greatest income inequality that we’ve had in a century. We have no economic mobility left in this country and for 40 years, the bottom 90 percent of Americans haven’t shared in any of the economic growth. That is the central challenge of our time. A democracy cannot survive this lack of economic mobility, and that’s what the next President has to address. REPORTER: Sounds like you think people will have it, but they do not necessarily deserve it? BENNET: I think that our tax code is desperately unfair. I think that we’ve cut taxes by five trillion dollars, mostly on rich people, since 2001. Donald Trump made that even worse with the tax cut that he passed, and I don’t think it makes sense to have these massive transfers of intergenerational wealth that we don’t tax. So that’s something that we’ve got to fix.","Look, people work hard and make a lot of money. I don’t begrudge them that they earn their money. What troubles me is the fact that the Federal government so often favors the wealthy over working people. I look at this country, and for decades now, there’s been an agenda in place that favored the 1% that use all the tools of the Federal government to put more money in the hands of the few and to, very consciously, avoid rewarding the folks that do the hard work every day. That’s why so many working class and middle class Americans feel they’re working harder and harder and they’re getting less and less for it. One of the things I talk about, very bluntly, is there’s plenty of money in this world. There’s plenty of money in this country, it’s just in the wrong hands. It has been very clear to me that money’s gotten concentrated in the hands of very few people because of federal policies. And that’s created a sense of unfairness, a sense this society is no longer working for working people. This election has to be about whether we’re going to have a fair economy or a fair society again. Whether work’s actually going to be rewarded. If we don’t fix these problems, I really fear the kind of income inequality, the stratification that undermines the social fabric of this country. And not just the social fabric of this country, but undermines our national security because we will not be a unified country if this level of inequality continues to grow.","I think that we make a mistake in this country when we confuse wealth with worth, and I think the nation and the values we have are really being challenged right now. That, not only people will mistake wealth with worth, they may mistake celebrity with significance. And so, I think the strivings we should have should be to make a contribution to make a difference in the world. So, you know, how much money you have, to me, is inconsequential to what you do with that. And this idea of shared prosperity, not just economically, but shared prosperity in terms of well-being, in terms of a meaning in life, I think that this is a challenging point in American society, where we see forces trying to erode what gives life meaning and substance. And I think that’s why we’re seeing this rise in deaths of despair from opioid addiction to suicides, and we really need to start talking about, not what’s a matter with us, but what matters to us as a society. REPORTER: Does it bother you, though, to see people with that much wealth, or is it really a question of making sure it’s a broadly shared properity? BOOKER: You know, what bothers me is when we are a nation that got here, not because of rugged individual and our self-reliance, but because of this idea of a shared purpose and common sacrifice. I’m bothered when people don’t understand that they have an obligation to use their best measure of devotion, of resources, to sacrifice for the greater good. And knowing that we’re all here because of people that were willing to storm beaches in Normandy or Iwo Jima or people that were willing to stand together and die together for worker’s rights, for civil rights, people like Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, who gave the ultimate sacrifice, for people to live lives that are not oriented around that understanding that we must do for each other, that frustrates me. But, again, this should be an everyday struggle. I always tell people that the biggest thing you can do anything today is a small act of kindness and decency or generosity. So, I try not to cast judgment. I struggle everyday to live up to my own ideals of service and contribution, and whether that means, hey, when I earn money, I try to make sure that I’m being generous with that and evidencing the values I want to see in the world, and before I cast judgment on another, let me live by my own values, because you can talk about people with a billions dollars, but heck, I’m, as a senator, I make $175,000 a year. What am I doing with my resources, before I point to someone else?","To me at least, it’s not about, it’s about everybody actually deserves to have enough money and the opportunity to feed their family and live a better life than what they lived growing up. And I think far too often now, you know, I grew up in the 1970s, 90 percent of 30 year olds were doing better than their parents were. Now it’s only half. 44 percent of America, if they had an emergency where they needed $400, they’d either have to borrow it, or go somewhere else. So the average American worker hasn’t really had a real pay increase in 40 years. So yes, someone may well deserve if they earned a billion, but I’m more concerned about the person that deserves to be able to take care of their family and live a better life than their parents did.","I’m not sure anybody cosmically or morally deserves to have a billion dollars, but I don’t hold it against them, as long as it’s a part of a system where there’s economic justice felt more broadly. I think the reason you see a lot of resentment of billionaires today is not strictly because of how well they’re doing, but how well they’re doing in an environment that seems to route virtually all of the gains of human productivity toward a tiny number of people.","If they’ve worked hard and come about it fairly. But I agree with people who say that our system is out of order right now. That we have tremendous income inequality. We have too many people at the top who are doing very well. And more and more people in the middle class and near the bottom of the economic scale that are doing worse and worse. And that’s why we need a Washington that actually works for people who are working hard and rewards hard work, instead of making it easier and easier for the people that are at the top, expecting less and less of them and a very big corporate interest.","I think, for example, if someone were to create the machines that would solve climate change and they did that as an entrepreneur in the private sector and created extraordinary innovation that added massive value to the world, and they made a billion dollars off of that, I don’t have a problem with that. To me, the real question is not, do people deserve to have a billion dollars, but, do we deserve to live in a country where half of the population can’t afford $500? Do we deserve to live in a country where so many people struggle? And I think the answer to that, particularly for the people who are struggling, and for all of us as citizens is, no. So I think of it more in that way. I don’t worry as much about what people at the top do. You know, if they’ve played by the rules and done a great job, and live in a free market capitalist society and are very successful. But, I worry deeply about people who are struggling, who don’t have opportunities, who have been left behind, who really have just such a difficult burden in their day-to-day lives, living in poverty, and being oppressed. And I really want to do things to help those people. And to do those things, sometimes it requires money when you have to have tax policy that inevitably ends up taxing those who have been most blessed and most successful in life. So that’s kinda how I think about it. REPORTER: So that sounds like a yes, but a qualified yes. DELANEY: Yeah, because I’m not sure deserve is the right question. I don’t know if that’s the right question. We live in a free market economy. If someone in 200 years makes a billion dollars, what does it mean compared to today? I’m a capitalist, I believe in the extraordinary promise that the free market provides to people in terms of the ability to lift them up, that it’s the greatest innovation in the job creation machine, ever. But I believe really strongly in strong social programs to help people who are struggling to make sure young people have opportunity, to protect our citizens against threats, and those programs often come with a cost. So, yeah, does someone deserve a billion dollars if they do something great? Sure. But what we don’t deserve is to live in a country where so many people struggle.","Look, those who work and earn money in this country, it’s not a bad thing. It’s how they do that and what they do with it, I think matters. I think the fact that we have had such an imbalance in our country with vast income inequality, where our laws benefit the very few, making it easy for the richest to get even richer, while the middle class and the poor continue to struggle is what’s wrong, and that’s what we need to fix.","I think the American dream is about letting people aspire to whatever they can accomplish. But your question I think goes to a bit more of fairness and how we invest in our whole community and the common good, and I think those who are deeply successful should invest more.","I mean, if they earn it and work hard for it, sure. But let’s also be very clear that we should never make an assumption that everyone has equal opportunity to earn a billion dollars, because most people in our country do not. Most people in our country are not starting out on at a level that allows them to have access to an opportunity for economic success, and we have to correct for that. For so long, really for generations, the rules have been written in a way that have excluded working people, have excluded middle class families, and we’ve got to address that. I will never be upset with anyone for achieving success, but never should we assume that everyone has an equal opportunity to get on that path of success, because that’s just not the case in our country.","I think that people in this country have always had these aspirational values to make a billion dollars or to make, you know, in the old days, it used to be, to be a millionaire and I think that’s what drives a lot of our economy. The question is, people that make large sums of money, is there not some obligation that they should help create opportunity or enhance the opportunity for others to be able to have the same success, the same achievement that they did.","You know, there’s a line from one of my favorite movies “Unforgiven,” Clint Eastwood, where he says “deserves got nothing to do with it.” The question is, how do we really have an economy that works for everyone. And 50 percent of Americans have not had a raise. When I’m president of the United States, we’re going to have a jobs program that I just rolled out for eight million family waged jobs, that’s what America needs. REPORTER: Was that a yes or a no? INSLEE: I don’t know how to call it deserve. Deserve is in the eye of the beholder. What we need is an economy that grows wages for those in the bottom half who haven’t had a wage increase in the last 20 years. That’s what I want to focus on.","I think that people deserve to work hard, and make money, and they can make a billion dollars, but the key to me is: How does our country make sure that there’s shared prosperity? That means if you got a billion dollars, you should be sharing more of it with your fellow citizens, presumably, those are the citizens that basically made the economy work for you. You should be sharing that prosperity in terms of where we put taxes, how you give back to our country. That’s why I am so concerned with the Republican tax cut that just passed because it helped those billionaires a whole lot more than it helped people that are just trying get by to put their kids in school, and to really pursue the American dream. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for a fair country and an even playing field. My grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines in Ely, Minn. He never got to graduate from high school because he had to go to work, and he saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to college, community college, then University of Minnesota, and my mom it was basically the same thing. That’s why you can have billionaires, but they should be giving back, and we should have policies to make sure we let everyone succeed.","Sure, if you earn it fairly. We live in a country that is founded on the principle of equal opportunity. We are not a country of equal results. There’s competition, free market competition, some people will do better than others. We just have to make sure opportunity truly is fair and equal. And then if you can be successful, then good for you.","That’s a good question. I don’t know that anyone deserves to have a billion dollars. I think we have a concentration of wealth, and power and privilege in this country that we haven’t seen since the last Gilded Age. And that concentration of wealth and power works counter to our democracy. So, both from a perspective of making sure that we have the resources to invest in people and communities, so that everyone is educated enough and well enough, and able to participate in economic life in this country, and to ensure that everyone sees a future for themselves, and there are not some who have better access to our democracy, to shaping the direction of this country, to guiding the course of this nation. It’s very important that we break down that concentration, and ensure that we have a greater level of equality in the United States.","Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. That’s a high-class luxury. I think they should certainly pay more in taxes if they are making that level of money given all of the investments and debts and things we need to do. But I also believe that we shouldn’t ask anybody for more money, whether they’re a middle class person or a billionaire, if we’re going to dump it into a bunch of broken systems that we have today, like broken healthcare system, broken criminal justice system, broken education system, broken immigration system, broken agriculture system, broken food system. I think we need to reform the government, and then ask those people to pay more into the new systems that we’re reforming so that we’re not wasting all of the money that we’re wasting today. But I have no problem asking them for more.","In America today we have grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality. Tonight you’re going to have some 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got about half of the people in this country living paycheck to paycheck. So, we need a economic system, and we need a tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. My guess is when you have that you’re not going to have too many billionaires left.","Sure, this is America. If you work hard, this should be a country where your potential is limitless. However, my problem is that it’s a top-floor economy, and success is more and more confined just to the top floors, and we have a tax system that reinforces that. So I want it to be a country where anyone who works hard can see that add up to something. And for some people, if it’s an idea good enough or if work hard enough, sure I still don’t mind someone being a billionaire.","In a world where kids are not getting opportunities, where schools have tiles that are falling down and teachers that are underpaid. When kids are struggling with a trillion and a half dollars in student loan debt, then I got a lot of problems with billionaires who are not paying a fair share. But, look at it the other way. In a world where every kid gets an opportunity, where schools are really good for all our kids, where we don’t crush people on student loan debt, where wages are going up across the economy, where when companies do better, their employees do better. In that world, we can have billionaires and it’s great and we can celebrate. It’s really about whether or not growth and prosperity in this country just all goes to the top — and that’s what creates billionaires. Or, whether or not growth and prosperity is something that everybody gets a chance to participate in. REPORTER: So that’s a nuanced answer. WARREN: I know it is, but it’s a true answer. And that’s the best I can do. This is because it’s a question that isn’t meaningful outside its moorings. It’s a question that takes its context. So I know it’s a long and complicated answer, but I think it’s the right answer.","Yes, there are people who deserve to have a billion dollars. I do believe that there is such a thing as righteous commerce. The problem is not that some people in America are rich. The problem in America is that not enough people can get rich. The problem is not just the accumulation of wealth. The problem is that we have a government that now passes policies that make it easier for those who already have a lot of money to get richer, and for those who don’t have much money even to thrive. So, that’s the problem. But some people have made a billion dollars in righteous ways, and good on them. I think they should pay more in taxes, for sure, but I have no problem with the idea that they deserve to have it, if in fact they made it righteously.","Well, deserve is a freighted word. Our economic system is designed so that billionaires would be a very natural byproduct. We have this winner take all economy, where you’d expect a number of billionaires and that’s what we have. Whether someone deserves it, that suggests that there is some sort of moral weighting scale, where one person deserves it, other people don’t deserve it. And I’m sure even most billionaires don’t think that they’re somehow 10,000 times more worthy than the average person. If you have to ask if it was just a yes or no question, like do I think that there’s something intrinsically wrong there being billionaires in the world, no, I do not."
