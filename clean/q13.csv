"1","13"," Should tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google be broken up?","I think, first of all, all of those companies are different from each other and it’s worth thinking about that. I think we should absolutely examine whether they should be broken up and we should have the antitrust division of the Justice Department take a look at that.","so many ways in recent years —the spread of misinformation, the interference by foreign governments in our elections, the ways that privacy was, in so many ways, undermined. There’s something wrong with the status quo, it can’t go on. And by the way, this is a country with a rich history of using antitrust laws to recognize when companies have become too powerful, too big, these tech companies are there. They are part of our society, they can continue to do their work, but we have to address the size, the power, and the concentration of power that now exists. It’s not healthy for our country. REPORTER: Can I ask you for a yes or no answer? de BLASIO: I thought I gave you one. REPORTER: Say the word. de BLASIO: Do it again. REPORTER: Should tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google be broken up? de BLASIO: Yes, we should use our antitrust laws. They’re there for a reason, and these companies have gotten too big, and the ramifications, the results for our democracy, have been too negative. We have to address that now, we have to break them up.  I get very angry when I think about the fact that these huge tech companies, while they were profiting greatly, were part of what broke down our democracy in","broad brush determinations. We have processes and systems that, albeit are not working like they should. They should evaluate these things using a lens towards what’s in the best interest of our society. We have had a problem in our country of moving away from the kind of antitrust enforcement — we used to do in a more robust fashion that led to a fairer economy, to more shared prosperity. And I worry deeply, right now, about the corporate consolidation that’s affecting every sector in, to me, ways that are working against free markets and working against the interests of people. So from the pharma section, to the agricultural sector, we are seeing corporate consolidation in ways that’s worrisome. And so, as president of the United States, I’m going to make sure that we put judges in place that actually will enforce antitrust laws. I’m going to make sure that we have a Justice Department that does the appropriate investigations and breaks up many of these, or fights to break up of any of these unjust consolidations of economic power. And so, whether that’s the tech sector or the ag sector, or the pharma sector, I’ll be far more aggressive in enforcing antitrust laws. I think we have a problem with corporate consolidation and we’re hurting as a society. I’ve seen this painfully in many sectors, including the farm sector. I literally have put in a bill that said we should put a moratorium on corporate consolidation in the agricultural sector because the independent family farmers are hurting, being driven out of business, their share of the consumer dollar is going dramatically down. Because we have two or three companies who control the overwhelming majority of the seed, providing the chemicals needed for farmers. They’re getting squeezed from above by having instead of five or six people to sell their goods to, having one company dictating to them price. These are the kinds of things that we need the president to fight against. So I’m going to be one of those that does that kind of fight, because we need to create an economy that works for everyone, not crony capitalism and not unchecked corporate consolidation.  I worry about any president that it makes — or presidential candidates — making","I think tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google first ought to have a lot more obligations to our society. The fact that Amazon made $10 billion of profits, and didn’t pay any taxes last year, shows structural issues altogether. The fact that Google — half of its employees are independent contractors, don’t necessarily get the benefits and the wages that others do, it’s problematic. When it comes directly to breaking them up, you know, antitrust used to be about both controlling markets where Amazon now controls 80 percent of Internet sales. But it used to just be about the dollars, not from a privacy perspective. I think that we do need to take a look at, as they grow bigger, from the perspective of applying antitrust laws to break them up.","American economy. The consolidation can very quickly turn into a kind of monopoly power that diminishes our freedom and squashes competition. REPORTER: Can’t tell if that’s a yes or a no. BUTTIGIEG: I mean, there has to be a due process for something like this. But there is no question that the bar has been drawn far too lightly in my lifetime. I think the F.T.C. needs to be empowered to prevent, and in some cases reverse, the mergers of some of these companies, not just in tech, but across the","attention. I do believe that at the Department of Justice, we need to scrutinize more, these kinds of big companies and potential mergers, whether they are in the tech industry, the telecom industry, agribusiness, any number of different industries. When it comes to agribusiness, for instance, one of the things that I’ve told the people of Iowa is that we need to ensure that we don’t only look at the impact of a potential merger on consumer price. We also look at what it’s doing to smaller companies up and down the production chain. So we need a Department of Justice that is focused, of course, on what it means to the consumer, but also what these mergers mean to small business. Perhaps, in some instances. I think that that’s something that’s worth our","I think the first thing to do with tech giants is to significantly increase the regulation of them and make sure we’ve updated not only the antitrust laws in this country, but the communications laws in this country. So that they can be appropriately regulated and they don’t exercise monopoly power. Whether that leads to them being broken up or not, I think, will be a question to be determined once we have the appropriate regulation. I think we’ve been woefully deficient in actually regulating these companies. You know, I favor digital privacy legislation at the federal level very similar to what California has done. I think that’s the right framework. I favor updating the Telecommunications Act and our antitrust laws to actually address companies with the kind of scale and capabilities that many of these companies have. I favor putting in place other regulations on, you know, their ability to put political advertising out there without disclosure. It’s kind of ridiculous that they’re allowed to advertise, or politicians or, you know, political groups can put content on social media and not disclose who paid for it. So, I think there’s a tremendous amount of stuff we need to do around privacy, around making sure the American people have access to their data, they understand what their data’s being used for, to make sure that we have an economy where these companies just can’t gobble up any kind of new entrepreneurs or new startups that have promising technology because I think there’s some very significant antitrust issues associated with the concentration of power in these companies. So, that’s what I favor.","monopolies and such power that — and there have been examples of their abuse of that power, both in invading and violating our personal privacy and civil liberty rights, as well as crushing any who seek to challenge their monopoly.  I do. I think that these tech giants like Facebook and Google have such","believe there are grave concerns about monopolistic practices by the largest platforms that exist today. I think we need far more oversight and accountability because for anyone to be able to buy a Facebook ad in rubles just shows the lack of knowledge of their customers. They should have the basic requirements as a bank does to know their customers, so that they can’t be used to interfere with our elections. I think the platforms also need far more accountability and transparency in how they’re being used to sow disinformation and to provoke and spread hate. And so I’d like to see a far greater level of oversight and accountability. I don’t know what you mean when you say break up these institutions, so I don’t know how to assess that idea.I do know they need far more oversight and accountability and regulation.  I believe that monopolies are problematic in whatever industry they exist, and I","I believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure, and the American consumer can be certain,that their privacy is not being compromised. REPORTER: But not necessarily to reduce the size of the company? HARRIS: My first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact, and that consumers have the power to make decisions about what happens with their personal information and that is not being made for them.","I think that we’re in a system in American capitalism, where large companies in many industries are making it much harder for smaller companies to succeed. If you go back over the last 20 years, we can see a clear decline in the number of new businesses that are being started every year. And part of that is addressing the enormous size of some of these companies. Now, we have laws and rules in place in how to approach the issue of, are these large companies in some way obstructing what we think our open market should do? And I think we should certainly be examining that. Certainly, again and again, these large mergers between our major corporations, oftentimes, the only real benefit to society is to the very narrow, that the infinitesimally small group of people that are their shareholders. In other words, when two large corporations in any industry merge together, the value capture team goes and decides which of the two teams of marketing, which of the two teams of accountants, which of the two teams in every sector of that company’s or those two companies operations, some people stay and some people go. And that’s the value capture. That’s where the merger makes economic sense. In most cases, that’s not helping the overall community. It’s just putting more people out of work. And I think that’s the challenge is when is too big, when is a company too big? We have processes in place to examine that and look at it just as Teddy Roosevelt did, just as Franklin Roosevelt did. I think that’s just going to be revisited frequently. REPORTER: But you wouldn’t, at this point, say those three companies — HICKENLOOPER: I think we have a process to go through rather than just me saying, me making a unilateral decision. We should be looking at a lot of these mergers and a lot of the size of some of these companies. The system now whereby you have — some of these large, behemoth companies that pay no taxes, and yet they’re creating remarkable share, shareholder value. Are they enhancing our open markets, our capitalistic system in America, or are they in some way beginning to compress the overall value to society? We’re at a point now where you step back and for the middle class, we need to be able to create security and opportunity for poor people. We have to create some level of security and certainly opportunity. In many cases, that’s no longer happening and we have to look at every possible solution to that.","I believe that we have to enforce antitrust laws. I believe that we have to regulate privacy. We’ve come very close to passing the best privacy laws in the United States so that those tech giants do not violate our privacy and do not violate consumer laws. Whether they are broken up depends on the specifics of the antitrust law as it applies to them individually. I’ve been very aggressive to making sure consumers are protected, I’d continue to do that.","have to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws to figure out what should be broken up and how. One example when I’m president, I will make sure that we have a stronger Justice Department and F.T.C., and I will work to pass my bill and push it through from the White House to better fund those departments. And you can do it by charging extra fees on mega-mergers, and make sure the parties are paying for it. And some of that money can be used to look back at existing monopolies. I’m talking about things like Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and looking at the services and how all of this is integrated. We are literally in a new Gilded Age, and it is not just about tech companies. People question why pharma prices have shot up. Well, look at what happened with EpiPen. Look what happens with insulin. When competition goes away, prices go up, innovation goes down. It’s not just in tech. I am the ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, have long worked on this issue, and I’m excited as the president to be able to actually make this happen, and that means review of monopolies that are existing. That means better review of monopolies that are proposed, and that also means changing some of the standards that are in law right now so that we can adapt to monopsonies, and other entities because our government should be as sophisticated as the companies that are merging before us. And by the way, this isn’t some radical idea. This goes back to our Founding Fathers. It is Adam Smith if you want to look at the father of modern-day capitalism, who warned us about the standing army of monopolies. That’s what’s happening and we’re going to reduce competition and hurt capitalism if we don’t do something about this spreading problem of monopolies. They may well be broken up, but I think you have to look at the facts and you","We should certainly be having that discussion. I don’t think we need to break them up right now, but we’ve got to regulate them more effectively. They’re controlling our lives. They have all our data and we are getting nothing in return. We’ve got a — there’s clearly antitrust issues going on with Google and Amazon in particular — and we’ve got to address this. This is part of regulation. This is part of reform. In the same way that the trustbusters in the early part of the last century dealt with these new big companies, like the oil companies, it’s our job in this generation to deal with these new conglomerates, these new monopolies, and make sure they’re playing fair, so that we can have good, free market competition around all things in the United States.","I don’t know. I don’t know whether it is appropriate for a candidate for the presidency, or for the president, him or herself, to be designating which companies should be broken up. But what I can say, is that we must have far stronger regulations to protect our privacy and our personal information. These tech giants are clearly unable or unwilling to do that without greater federal oversight. As president I would embolden the F.T.C., to make sure that there is far greater oversight and protection for people and their data, at a time when the people of this country have in effect become the products that are marketed on these platforms. Whether it’s Facebook, or Twitter, or Snapchat or Instagram, we need greater protections. And as president I will make sure that we provide them.","going to be of doing it. I think it is a discussion that we need to have. I wouldn’t be afraid to do it. But right now, I don’t think they’re meeting the standards that we need them to meet around privacy, around, you know, what we saw in the past elections, and a variety of issues. So, I think that’s a discussion we need to have.  I think we need to look at breaking them up, and see what the ramifications are","The answer, in general, is yes. But I think this is an area that we are so far behind. Public policy is so far behind the explosion of technology that it is really one of the weaknesses of where we are right now as a country. When you talk about the power of tech companies, you’re talking about how we look at the workforce in coming years. What does artificial intelligence in robotics mean for the jobs that we’re going to have? You’re talking about the invasion of our privacy, the fact that these tech giants know more about us than anybody would ever dream that they know, etc., etc. So, this is a huge issue. Public policy hasn’t even begun to dent it. But I am very concerned, not only with tech giants, I’m concerned with Wall Street. I’m concerned with agribusiness, of the incredible power of a handful of giant corporations over the people of this country. We need an attorney general who understands antitrust legislation. And I think absolutely that that would apply to the tech giants as well.","better used, and that we need to start looking at anticompetitive practices broadly across tech. I also believe that we need a national privacy law so that, in our country, people are aware of how their data is being used, what they are opting into exactly, and also that social media companies need to have better — they need to take more responsibility for how their platforms are being used, particularly now, knowing that foreign adversaries are using their platforms to interfere in our elections. So, it’s the government starting to step up and exercise the authorities we already have, and social media companies, you know, being held to a higher standard and expected to do more to make sure that their platforms aren’t being misused. No, but I do think the antitrust division at the Department of Justice could be","broken up. Look, here’s the deal. They run a platform — Amazon for example — where you can go and see 26 different toasters that can be delivered by tomorrow at 4 o’clock. And that’s where a lot of people who want to buy online, a lot of people who want to sell online come. That’s a marketplace. That’s great. But they are also running a business, Amazon is. So they watch, oh, who’s doing fancy things with coffee makers or pet pillows or whatever they’re doing. And they decide, you know, there’s profit to be made in that little corner of the market — pet pillows. So they take the little business that has invested heart and soul, put tons of money and time and energy and heart into this, and they move them back to page seven, put Amazon pet pillows up at page one, destroy the competition and suck up new profits for themselves. So, here’s how I see this: It’s like in baseball. You can be the umpire — that is you can run the platform, the marketplace — or you can have a team in the game, that is you can be one of the competing businesses. But you don’t get to do both at the same time. And that’s why they should be broken apart.  Yes, I believe that tech giants, like Facebook, Amazon and Google, should be","giantism is a malfunction in society. That is why we have antitrust laws. That is why we have antimonopoly clauses. And so, yes, I believe that the tech companies have become giants in ways that make it very, very difficult, even for the free market. I mean how many young Mark Zuckerbergs might there be out there? How many young Jeff Bezoses might there be out there? So that’s why I think it’s — yeah, I have no problem with the idea of breaking some of these companies up.  I think giantism is a malfunction. Giantism is a malfunction in the body, and","So, it is definitely the case that technology companies have become too big and that those industries have consolidated in ways that have been unprecedented. It’s also the case that Congress has been flying blind on this for 24 years because they got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995, and so if you have the sense that our government is decades behind the curve in technology, you are right. The temptation, though, is to say break them up, which is frankly a 20th-century solution to a 21st-century set of problems. And there are dynamics in technology, right now, that make it so that competition isn’t always the answer. As an example, none of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app. We just want to know what the best app is going to be that has the most up-to-date traffic info. So it’s not a situation where you’re like, “Oh, if we have more apps competing, like that’s somehow going to always be what we want.” Another example is that right now, to me, one of the primary concerns we should be having about social media companies is that we’ve seen a surge in depression and anxiety and mental health issues, among teenage girls in particular, that are coincident with the rise of smartphone use and the use of certain social media apps. As one of my friends in Silicon Valley says, “We have some of the smartest engineers in the country turning super computers into slot machines and dopamine delivery devices for teenagers.” So saying break them up in the case of Facebook, if you had Facebook broken up into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, that does not necessarily make our children any stronger. So there are certain situations where we’d want to divest. We would want to tech companies to divest parts of their businesses, that’s the “break them up.” But there are many other, more nuanced problems that we actually need to be working with these tech companies to resolve, and so it’s much more nuanced than a 20th-century solution to a 21st-century set of issues."
