"1","8"," Do you think illegal immigration is a major problem in the United States?","I do not think illegal immigration is a major problem in the United States. I do think our broken immigration system is a major problem. I was part of the Gang of Eight in 2013 — four Democrats and four Republicans — who wrote the comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate with 68 votes. I think that still could be the basis of fixing our immigration system.","I think we have, in this country, an immigration crisis that’s self-created. And we’re going through a national identity crisis that we have to resolve and we can. Look, I represent half a million people who happen to be undocumented. But they’re our neighbors, they work with us in our workplaces. They’re our friends, they’re our fellow human beings. You know, when I’m on the subway or when I’m in the supermarket, I don’t know who’s documented and who’s undocumented. I do know that we should have laws that provide comprehensive immigration reform and allow everyone who’s here now to have a pathway to stay and, you know, follow the right rules that allow them to stay. We have a nation that’s now, in so many ways, set against ourselves. We need people to bring their skills and talents here. We need work to be done all over this country that’s only happening because there are immigrants here to contribute to our economy. But we can’t seem to work it out. And actually, the American people are pretty advanced, in my view, and thinking this through and they want a solution. They think the Dreamers should be allowed to stay, they believe that we should stop punitive policies like family separation and they want a lasting immigration reform. And that’s what I would focus on as president. Really following that American majority that wants to settle this issue, once and for all, and stop this conflict that’s just holding us back. REPORTER: I can’t totally tell if that’s a yes or a no. de BLASIO: I think we have an immigration crisis. I think we can have a system that allows us to make sense of people coming here in a productive way. Right now, we don’t have that.","I think we have challenges with undocumented immigrants in our country. And a lot of those challenges is by forcing them into the shadows, we are creating a less safe environment. The Trump administration policies have made many communities less safe, and I know this having been a former mayor, it’s that right now in the city I used to govern, we have immigrant communities who are afraid to come forward with police, reporting everything from — afraid to report everything from domestic violence to real serious crimes, because we created an atmosphere of fear, which is always a toxic atmosphere. We need to make sure that we create systems that work for our safety and our well-being, that help to expand our economy, that affirm the truth of a lot of people that are in this country, like Dreamers, that they are citizens in every way in our country, except for a piece of paper. And we also need to do the right things that protect our country from illegal drugs coming in, and other challenges. We can affirm our values as a country and have immigration systems that support our economy, that grow our country, and that make sure that we stay secure and strong. And this lie that somehow all of these things are mutually exclusive, that we can’t affirm our values, keep ourselves safe, grow our economy and make sure that people are on pathways to citizenship that are already here — we can do those all, and I’ll be the kind of president that gets that kind of comprehensive immigration reform done.","I think that — at least I, I think even most Democrats believe in border security and keeping families safe, an orderly economy. But you look at southern border as an example, the number of people being apprehended are about a third of what they were even two decades ago. The idea that, O.K., we should just build a wall, sort of that 18th-century solution to a 21st-century problem. So, at the end of the day we should have an orderly immigration system, but all of this folly also just shows how we need to be doing more when it comes to immigration reform and Washington D.C. has been so broken that, they haven’t even taken that first step? REPORTER: But do you think it’s a major problem? BULLOCK: Do I think that illegal — REPORTER: Illegal immigration, yes — BULLOCK: I think that most families are worried about, do they have health care? Are their kids going to do well, better than themselves? Can you afford education? So, there’s a whole host of problems out there. I don’t know, I wouldn’t classify it as bigger than if I’m going to have health care tomorrow.","I think the big problem in the United States is that we lack comprehensive immigration reform. We have over 10 million undocumented immigrants in the country who need a pathway to citizenship. They’re often participating fully in communities, and even as taxpayers, but aren’t able to have full citizenship, and the rights and responsibilities that go with that. Of course, we need things like border security and we need to clean up our lawful immigration process too. The biggest crisis around immigration today is the inhumanity of this administration’s policies. Yeah, our broken immigration system is a problem. One of the things that it leads to is a lot of people of uncertain, or undocumented status in this country with no clear path ahead of them.","Illegal immigration is an issue that this administration has drummed up to cause fear and paranoia. There are a lot of people at the southern border that are coming, requesting asylum. We have a lot of people who are fleeing Central American countries, that are doing so because they can’t find safety and opportunity in their home country. I believe that we need to decriminalize our immigration system and go back to treating it as a civil violation. That we need to change completely how we look at this issue, instead of choosing cruelty, the way that this administration wants us to do. The way that they have separated little children from their families, I believe that we need to choose compassion. We have a border that is probably more secure than it ever has been, with more resources dedicated to it than we ever have. And the people that are coming do not represent a threat to our national security. We need to end detention. We need to make sure that people seeking asylum can make their claim for asylum in an orderly way at our ports of entry. We need to raise the number of refugees that we accept into the United States. And we need to end programs like 287(g), that turn local officials into federal immigration officials. So, I have a completely different view of what we need to do on immigration from what this president does. REPORTER: Is it that you don’t see it as a problem at all or that you just see it as a very different kind of problem then President Trump does? CASTRO: Well, I recognize that we have a challenge on our hands with so many people trying to come into the United States at the southern border. But I believe that there’s a better, stronger solution to it than cruelty and stoking up fear and paranoia and criminalizing these people. Instead, what we need to do is put in place the ability to process these claims. These folks do not represent a threat to our national security. We need to treat them humanely and compassionately. And we have to recognize that we have a secure border right now, and we can make the right investments to things like technology at our ports of entry to make sure that we are able to detect — to catch human trafficking and drug trafficking better than we do today. In the long run, what I believe is that we need a 21st-century Marshall Plan for Central America and Latin America, so that people can find safety and opportunity there, instead of having to come and knock on the door of the United States.","I don’t think it’s a major problem, but I do think we need to fix our broken immigration system. One of the fundamental responsibilities of government is to update the basic institutions in our society based on how the world has changed. And the world has changed a lot and immigration patterns have changed. What’s gone on with our country economically has changed, and we really have an outdated immigration system. So, I don’t think illegal immigration is a problem in our country at this point. What is a problem, is the fact that we have 11 million undocumented residents in our country, many of which are adding a lot of value to our country. And they have a right to — or we should give them the ability to have a path to legal status and hopefully over time, to citizenship. I think that’s in the common interest of the American people.","Our broken immigration system is a major problem in this country. Both with the challenges that we continue to see at the border, as well as the broken legal immigration system. That must be addressed.","Immigration has always been a strength in this country. Our diversity is a strength. And I believe that we need a much better approach towards immigration. We need comprehensive immigration reform, and one of the reasons why I’m running for president is I despise what President Trump is doing at the border. We should never be separating families, children from their parents. We should never be locking people up in inhumane conditions who are seeking our help. So, I would reimagine what we do at the border. I would make sure we have a proper asylum program, have real immigration judges, make sure that we have a system that works for this country. And recognizing that immigration, really, has always been a strength.","I think the major problem for the United States is that we have not, and we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, period. REPORTER: Do you think illegal immigration is a problem at all? HARRIS: I think that there is no question that there is an administration in place right now that has vilified immigrants, that has played on the fear of people and has incited fear. And it is irresponsible. It is the height of irresponsibility, when in the name of supposed border security, that we are separating children from their parents. As far as I’m concerned, that’s a human rights abuse being committed by this administration. We have got to put in place a policy and law that allows the 11 million-plus people who are in this country, who are undocumented — that gives them an opportunity to be on the path to earn and to have status. And right now we have not done that. I also strongly believe that America should keep its promise to our Dreamers and those who receive DACA protection. And we told them that if they gave us information about the circumstances of their arrival and what they are currently doing, we told them that if you pass the vet, if you’ve proven that you’re productive and you’ve not committed any crimes, that you’d receive protection from deportation. This administration came in and broke that promise to these young people and that is a shame. It’s a shame. And it needs to be corrected. We need to keep our promise.","I think illegal immigration is a significant issue. It’s not as much of a problem in a country right now where we have 3.8 percent unemployment. But, that being said, we need a system where everyone plays by the rules. And I think we should overhaul our immigration program and we’re a nation built on immigrants, but we need to look at, where do we need the greatest help? Is it in agricultural immigrant workers? Is it in technology? Right now, our system doesn’t seem to have a rational framework of how it works best. REPORTER: But you don’t — it doesn’t sound like you see it as a crisis or anything like that. HICKENLOOPER: No, no, but I think certainly when I campaigned for reelection in Colorado in 2014, we saw again and again, people who had small businesses, commercial painting businesses, sheetrocking businesses, who wouldn’t pay their workers under the table and they had lost their businesses to people that were paying their workers under the table. And I think that is a significant problem.","I believe that our nation is founded on immigration. We respect and value diversity. I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against the Muslim ban. But yes, we have to have some degree of immigration in a way that’s lawful, and we should do that. And we should protect the Dreamers, as I have done, which is to get education for the Dreamers, and now we need comprehensive immigration reform — this is just to bring these folks into the true mainstream and citizenship in the United States. REPORTER: I can’t totally tell if that was a yes or a no on whether illegal immigration is a major problem. INSLEE: Listen, we want to have a legal system, we want to embrace refugees, like I have done in saying we should have Syrian refugees. I want to help the Dreamers, we want to encourage new streams of talent into America. But yes, we have some laws, and we are not going to allow illegality. We just need to follow the law, including allowing people to have asylum who deserve it and we need a rational way to do that.","I think that we have done nothing about immigration for so long, and we haven’t done enough to figure out a smart way to bring people that are in our country to citizenships — people who are obeying the law, people who have been willing to learn English. What do we need? Well, we need comprehensive immigration reform. The bill that we passed a few years back, to me, is a good formula. It basically gives people the right, as long as they follow the law, to pursue a path to citizenship. It’s economic. Nearly 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed up by immigrants — 25 percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries. We need workers right now in America in our fields, in our farms, in our nursing homes. I make the economic argument for immigration reform, no matter where I am in this country. And once you do that, the nonpartisan budget analysis on this bill was that it would bring the debt down by $158 billion. Everyone should want that. Once you have that money, yes, you can do more when it comes to personnel at the border. You can make sure that we’re smart about how we are handling cases at the border. But the answer is not an $8 billion wall. The answer is comprehensive immigration reform. REPORTER: On that question, it sounds like it’s somewhere between a yes and a no. KLOBUCHAR: Well, we have problems with immigration in this country, but it is a problem really of our own making because we have so many people here that want to part of our economy, and I think we need to have a path to citizenship, and allow them to participate in that economy. And that includes Dreamers, people who came over here by no fault of their own. So undocumented workers, to me, they don’t diminish America. They are America. And I think we have to find a way to make it work. That doesn’t mean that when people commit serious crimes — no matter who they are — that they don’t go to jail. Of course they do, but the key here is to have a system where we have order at the border, but we also have comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship.","Illegal immigration is an issue and Democrats have to admit that it’s something that we have to confront. Republicans have to be honest about the facts: That we need immigrants, that we’re a country of immigrants, that we have got to give a pathway of citizenship to Dreamers and others who are parts of our community and parts of our economy. But the truth of the matter is that there are a lot of Central Americans, in particular, coming to the southern border right now. What we should be doing is addressing that by giving targeted aid to Central America. To make it safe for these people to stay home if that’s where they would like to stay. Of course, Trump is doing the exact opposite. He’s exacerbating the problem. He’s making whatever crisis there is, worse. If you go to the border and you see asylum refugees who can’t get in, if you see kids literally in cages, you recognize that yes, this is a crisis and nobody thinks the system is perfect. So, it’s time for major reforms.","I think that immigration is one of the greatest opportunities for the United States. We just introduced a plan that would ensure that we speed the process by which those who have greencards in this country can become full U.S. citizens, participate to their full potential towards the betterment of this country. We bring millions out of the shadows, beginning with more than one million Dreamers, to ensure that they become U.S. citizens as soon as possible. They’re already contributing so much to the success and the greatness of this country, imagine what they can do as U.S. citizens. And then I want to make sure that we follow our asylum laws, and treat those who are coming to our border, fleeing some of the deadliest countries on the face of the planet, with the humanity that they deserve, that’s in the best interests and traditions of the United States of America. I will put an end to the chaos that Donald Trump has created at our border. Whether it’s the walls that he wants to build that we will not allow to be constructed, or no longer putting kids in cages or reuniting those families who have been separated. This country will begin living our values when it comes to our immigration laws. REPORTER: I can’t totally tell if that’s a yes or no on whether illegal immigration is a major problem. O’ROURKE: Undocumented immigration is an opportunity. It’s an opportunity for us to rewrite our laws that are in accord with our values, with the reality that we see in our communities and with the best interests of this country. We just need leadership that reflects that, and that’s the kind of leadership that I hope to be able to provide.","I think it’s a broken system. I think we need to turn it into an advantage for us. We need a strong border. We need to know who’s coming in and out of our country. I have a district and represent a state that has an opiate crisis. So we want to keep bad people and drugs out of our country, and it’s important for us to do that. We also need to be a compassionate country and accept people who are coming from war-torn areas or countries run by gangs. And we need to parlay the fact that people really want to be in the United States into our economic advantage and lead to growth and entrepreneurship and innovation. We’re losing people who want to start, and have started, billion-dollar companies that couldn’t get the proper paperwork done and stay in the United States. So they’re creating these businesses in Canada or China. And so, we can do both, and that’s the big problem with the debate today is you got to be on one side or the other. We can actually do both: strong borders and a compassionate, economically viable immigration system.","I think it is a problem. It is certainly not the kind of problem that Donald Trump makes it out to be. Trump is a demigogue trying to divide the American people up, and he’s picking on in a disgusting way the undocumented people in this country. So, it’s an issue, and we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need a path toward citizenship for the undocumented. We need to make sure that the 1.8 million young people in the DACA program get immediate legal protection. And we need a humane border policy for those who are seeking asylum.","I think undocumented immigrants need a path to citizenship in the United States. The crisis that I see are, you know, people leaving Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala coming to the U.S., risking everything, going across a hot desert with little food and little shelter and being received at the border. Not with open arms or shelter and, you know, compassion, but being separated, moms from their babies put in detention camps, and no resources to adjudicate the refugee claims. That’s the crisis that I see at the border. REPORTER: So you don’t see illegal immigration as such as a threat to the country. SWALWELL: Undocumented immigrants who come here for jobs, for opportunity, we need to have security at the border that makes sure that anyone who is not a lawful refugee is not able to come here. Anyone who is not going through the comprehensive process that we've set up is not able to come here. But I don’t accept the premise that the president puts out there that undocumented immigrants are creating a crisis in our country.","I think the biggest problem we’ve got right now starts down in Central America. The United States has withdrawn a lot of support in Central America. It’s a destabilized government. Gangs have taken over. And people are forced to flee for their lives. And as a consequence they end up at the American border, whether that’s what they really wanted to do or not, they’re pushed out. We want to have an immigration system that reflects our values. I think that what we need right now is an immigration system that does not build a wall. That’s not about safety, that’s a monument to hate. We need an immigration system that protects our Dreamers, that doesn’t break up families, that protects people who are here with temporary protective status and have built lives here, that reworks our visa program. Those are the kinds of things we need to be doing. An immigration system that’s consistent with safety and with our values. REPORTER: Would you say it’s a problem, but not the way Trump says? Or that it’s a challenge, but not a problem? WARREN: Can I say it differently? There are problems we need to solve in the immigration system right now. When I.C.E. locks up families, finds people who are coming to court to testify against bad guys, scoops people up in the hospital, that’s not increasing our security and it’s not consistent with our values. We need an immigration system that top to bottom is about our safety and is also about carrying out our values. We do those two things, we’ll have an immigration system that works.","I think even the languaging of illegal immigration is a problem in the United States. I think a lot of people don’t remember, perhaps never knew, that at one point Ronald Reagan just gave amnesty to eight million people. And before 1973, all people had to do, if they were not documented, was to go to a registry office. I think it’s so important for us to remember that immigration is a value in this country. It’s not just a policy. It’s a value. It’s a major spiritual and moral principle of the United States that we are open and welcoming to the stranger. You know, all four of my grandparents came through Ellis Island. And if you’re not descended from slaves who came from Africa, or if you’re not descended from Native Americans who were here for at least centuries before the white European settler came, who do you think you are? Who do we think we are? So, I think the idea of immigration is such a moral principle of public policy in the United States. And I think it’s important to remember that the immigrant brings at least as much to this country as this country brings to the immigrant. That is the characterological — you want to talk about exceptionalism, that is what is exceptional about this country, is the principle of belief that this should be a space of possibility for people to improve themselves and to have the lives they want — without the material caps that would otherwise thwart their dreams. So, I believe that what is going on today with the demonization of the immigrant is not just bad public policy, it’s immoral public policy. It is mean-spirited. It is unworthy of who we are.","So we have over 12 million people who are here in this country that are undocumented, that we know of. I mean it could be an even larger number. And we should not pretend that it is possible to somehow deport 12 million people. It would collapse regional economies. It would separate families. It’s essentially a non-starter. So right now, the status quo is we don’t know who everyone is and then we have problems with that and many of these people will show up in our emergency rooms or get into car accidents or other things where not knowing who they are is immensely problematic. And many of them are operating in an informal shadow economy where we aren’t having them integrated into the greater whole. And so I’m for a long-term path to citizenship for people who are here and undocumented. We need to create a path forward for people to see that they have a future here in this country. And this is particularly true because many of them have kids who’ve known no other life but America, and it would be, again, completely inhumane to separate families on that level."
