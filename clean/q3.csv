"1","3"," Do you think it’s possible for the next president to stop climate change?","I think we, as a country, leading the world, need to stop climate change. We need to make sure that temperatures don’t increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. We need no net new carbon by 2050. I think that is all well within our ability as humans I think that Americans should lead the way. REPORTER: Do you think the president, whoever that is, could do that, could stop it? BENNET: I do. I think that, in order to create a durable solution though, you can't do it two years at a time. It can't be one party does it for two years, the other party rips it out after that. We need a proposal that's broadly supported by the American people and drives economic growth at the same time we're dealing with climate change and I think we can do it. I'm absolutely convinced we can.","I think the next president has to take the lead in stopping climate change and yes, I think it can be done, but it’s going to take an entirely different approach. My city went through pain, so much suffering because of Hurricane Sandy. Dozens of people were lost in Hurricane Sandy. Billions of dollars of damage. I always say after Hurricane Sandy, there’s not a lot of climate deniers left in New York City. It’s clear to me the federal government has to lead the way with the Green New Deal. With the kinds of things we’re doing in New York City, right now, we’re moving our government car fleet to electric vehicles, we’re putting up electric charging stations all over city. We’re mandating that buildings have to be energy efficient. If not, we’re going to fine them. We’re divesting from fossil fuels. Five billions dollars in divestment from fossil fuels. We’re making sure that money is put into renewable energy investments. These are the kinds of things that should be happening on a vast scale with our federal government. The United Nations says we have 12 years to start to fix things. I believe that’s a real timeline we have to honor. We can do it if we take the full force of the federal government and devote it to the Green New Deal. And I’ve done it here in New York. I’ve proven it can be done in the biggest city in the country, in a tough environment, we’re proving these things really do work, they can work. We need to do it across our whole nation.","I think it’s possible for us to stop climate change. I think we gotta get away from this idea in America that think that our presidents are going to somehow be saviors. I’ve been telling people time and time again in this election that if you vote for me, I’m going to put a warning label that I’m going to be have to ask for more from you. Because what we’re doing right now is not enough. All of us have to be a part of the solution, and that means taking responsibility for the problems. That means actually admitting that there is a crisis, and we’ve got to understand that America can do so much more boldly, courageously, like we’ve done in past generations, to tackle global problems. But we can’t do it alone. We need to do it in partnership with others on the planet. That’s why the first thing I’m going to do, one of the first things I do in the hours I am president, will be rejoin the Paris accords, climate accords, and start to lead with every lever that I have, from diplomacy to foreign aid — every lever that I have — to make sure that we as a planet, that we as a human species, tackle this problem together, and end the crisis of climate change, which we have to face with a sense of urgency right now. And again, it’s not going to be one person in one office, it has to be a movement, a renewed commitment in our country and across this planet.","I do think it’s possible for the next president to finally take the steps to at least address climate change. I mean, all of the scientists say we need to do this over three decades. What we’ve seen so far though, is, first to step back, I think even George H.W. Bush 30 years ago said, we’ll actually... “We’ll take on the greenhouse effect with a White House effect,” meaning leadership will start from the top. And unfortunately because of the outside and the corrupting influences of dark money, Republicans can’t even acknowledge that climate change is human-caused. Coming from Montana the second worst fire season of my state’s history two years ago, farmers have different planting cycles, come to Glacier Park now cause it may be gone. So I do think the next president can lead, and we have to lead both globally and at home, pulling out of Paris when ultimately the U.S. can’t do this alone. We emit about half the greenhouse gases as China. We need to reinstate our international role, taking back, when the Trump administration rolled back cafe standards, not even the auto companies were asking for this. What I’d do is, I’d ultimately convene both conservationists, business, labor, scientists and say let’s have the short term path to make sure that we can hit these emissions reductions and over the next couple of decades, how can we get so that we are carbon neutral as a nation and indeed this world.","I think it’s possible for the next president to reverse the trajectory toward climate ruin that we’re on today. Can he do it in four years? Of course not. But that’s exactly why we need to act with the most urgency ever. This is a generational project. It’s going to have to be a national project. A good president will not only implement policies, but set the tone so that the public, and private, and social, and academic sectors of this country are all pulling in the same direction, and leading the world to do the same.","Yes, I think it’s possible for the next president to have a dramatic impact not only on how the United States combats climate change, but how the world does that. My first executive order, if I’m president, would be to recommit the United States to the Paris climate accord, so that we lead again on climate change. On top of that, I believe that we need to make massive investments in renewable energy, and in bringing down carbon emissions. I like the concept of a Green New Deal. I believe that we don’t have to choose between protecting our planet and growing jobs and growing our economy. We can do both of those things. One person alone can’t stop climate change, but this nation can lead. And it can get other nations around the world to be leaders. Doing that together, I’m confident that we can effectively combat climate change.","Yes. I do. I think it’s really one of the main priorities of the next president because we’re running out of time. Climate change is different than other problems. We have a problem with our infrastructure in this country. If we wait five years to build our infrastructure, it’s a missed opportunity but we haven’t dug ourselves a hole. If we wait another five or 10 years to address climate change, we’ve created a situation that is gonna be exceedingly difficult for us to get out of. I think the candidates running for president should be able to tell the American people is how are they going to get something done on climate? I believe I can. I believe I can get a carbon tax bill passed in my first year of president, put a price on carbon, take all that money and give it back to the American people in a dividend. I introduced that proposal in the Congress of the United States and it was bipartisan. I believe in my first year as president, I can get that passed with all the Democrats and with the Republicans who live in coastal states. Their citizens and their constituents are demanding they do something on climate. That will slow climate change down. It won’t stop it. To stop it, we fundamentally need innovation, which is why I’m calling for a fivefold increase in the Department of Energy research budget because we need to innovate new storage technologies, new energy transmission technologies. I’m calling for basically a moonshot around innovation and the best way to do that is by increasing the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold. I’m also calling for us to create a market for something called negative emissions technologies, or direct air capture technologies. These are machines that actually currently exist and they take carbon out of the atmosphere. The problem is, they’re not in scale and they’re way too expensive. They cost like $600 a metric ton and the social cost of carbon is like, $50 to a hundred dollars. But that’s a problem that the private sector can solve. We just have to create a market for them like we did with wind and solar who used to be way too expensive, and the prices have come down because we’ve created a market and the great American innovation economy got behind it. I’m calling for us to take the $5 billion of tax credits that we give fossil fuel companies and use that money to have the government basically purchase carbon from companies that actually create these technologies in an auction type approach, which will lead to the cost of these technologies coming down, and I believe these technologies can take 20 percent of the carbon in our atmosphere out of the atmosphere and not only get us to net zero in our country, which we need to be at 2050, but these technologies can actually save the world. If the United States of America really invents them and owns them, they’ll be the most valuable technologies in the world. I believe I have a real plan to deal with climate change. It’s actionable, and it’s very consistent with the way the American people have solved problems historically.","I think it’s important for us in this country, as well as leaders in the world to take the bold, aggressive action that we need to address the climate crisis that’s before us. The United States alone can’t accomplish this.","I think the next president must take on the issue of global climate change like the humanitarian urgency that it is. It is the greatest threat to humanity that exists. And so I think global climate change should be a moon shot for this generation. To say we are going to have a green economy in the next 10 years. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard. And pass a Green New Deal. Put a price on carbon, and make sure that we have the vision about how to create a green economy with green jobs, with investments in infrastructure, and clean air and clean water as a right.","I think that there’s no question that the next president has within her capacity the ability to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to help encourage human behaviors that are not contributing to climate change. We have seen that where there has been leadership on this issue that we can see results. And this has got to be something where there is leadership at the top that reflects the priorities of people across the country. I speak with farmers, I speak with people who are successful in business, I speak with students, I speak with grandparents and parents. Everyone knows that this is a real issue. And the fact that we have supposed leadership who is pushing science fiction instead of science fact will be to our collective peril. I do believe the next president of the United States can make this a priority and recognize the urgency of this issue, and the fact that this is an issue that presents an existential threat, frankly, to who we are as a species. And we can deal with it, because in large part it is human behaviors that have put us in the place that we are. And we can correct those behaviors.","Yeah, absolutely. I think the next president is going to be the last person who has a chance to stop climate change when it will still matter. The questions are not just what to do in this country, but how to accelerate adoption of strong actions all around the world, because it’s got to be a global solution.","I believe that if we have a president with a vision for a clean energy economy, we will not only defeat climate change, but we will build a clean energy economy with eight million jobs. I’m the candidate with a plan that says it has to be job number one, and I’m the candidate with a plan to put eight million people to work. And as a governor I’ve seen our ability to do this in Washington State where we have the best laws in the country. Yes, not only can we defeat climate change, it is the only option. Victory is the only option against climate change, because without victory there is not survival.","You can’t stop climate change, but you can respond to this crisis in a meaningful way that will reduce greenhouse gases. Right now, this president has done nothing. He is taking us backwards, and I believe that a voice from the heartland is important here because on the coast we know we have rising sea levels. We’ve seen the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, but it’s important to talk about what’s going on right now in the middle of the country. We’ve seen raging wildfires. We’ve seen firefighters die. We’ve seen tornados like we’ve never seen before. We’ve seen hail the size we couldn’t imagine in places spontaneously all over this country. I’ve seen a woman named Fran in Iowa near the Nebraska border who shows me her house submerged in water that she bought with her husband for their two four-year-olds, thought she’d live there forever. So there’s horse hair in the plaster because it’s a century old, and I said to her, “Well, is this water? You built this house or you bought this house right by the river?” She said, “No. The river is two-and-a-half miles away. The water has just never come this far before.” That’s what’s happening in the Midwest. So to me, the argument is, one, we can’t afford not to do anything. What do we do? We get back in the international climate change agreement, immediately. I do that on day one as president. We bring back the clean power rules that are on the cutting room floor. We reduce greenhouse gases by putting the gas mileage standards back in place that President Trump withdrew, and we pass sweeping legislation so we move forward on climate change. It is not happening 100 years from now. The climate crisis is happening now.","We’ve got to address climate change and we’ve got to be aggressive in doing it. I don’t know if one president is going to be able to do it but I think it’s incumbent on us to try. We have got to leave a livable planet for our kids and grandkids and we are not doing that right now. So, is it possible for one person to turn this around? Yes. Is it possible to fix it in the term of one presidency? Probably not, but we can get started in the right direction. REPORTER: So it’s possible to change the trajectory of the issue? MOULTON: Completely possible to change the trajectory of the issue so that we can solve climate change in our lifetimes. But are we going to be able to solve it in a four- or eight-year term? It’s gotten too bad.","I think it is possible for the next president to help lead this country to ensure that we confront climate change before it is too late. No one person nor any one political party will be able to do this on their own, it’s going to take this entire country. Our plan calls for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. It calls for America to be halfway there by 2030, a little more than a decade from where we are right now. Our administration will use executive authority to stop any new oil or gas leases on federal lands, to ensure that every dollar of federal procurement reflects the cost of climate change and pollution. Gives the opportunity to farmers, and those in rural America to lead on this issue as well. For example, paying farmers at a profit to plant cover crops to pull more carbon out of the air, and sequester more of it in the soil. If every single one of us, and every single part of the country does our part, then we can also take our rightful role on the world stage as the indispensable nation, convene the other powers of the planet to do their part as well, and halt the warming of this planet before it becomes so great that the droughts, the floods, the fires and the storms that we see today will pale in comparison for the generations that follow. We have 10 years within which to act, and I want to make sure that I do my part to make every single second count for as much as we can, to ensure that we do all that is possible while time still remains.","I do. Yes. We have to marshal every aspect of our society, our government, our free enterprise system, our educational institutions, our venture capital. All has to be pointing in the direction of reversing climate change. I think if we do it right, if we engage the free enterprise system, if we align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives, that we can actually do it a lot quicker than most people think.","Not alone, and not, certainly, just by doing what has to be done in the United States. Climate change by definition is a global crisis. And instead of having somebody in the White House who refuses to even acknowledge the reality of the problem, we need a president who is going to reach out to every country on earth and make it clear that this is a global issue and we have got to go forward together. My dream, and I don’t know that I can bring this around, but my dream is to convince countries around the world and instead of spending in total one and a half trillion dollars a year on weapons of destruction, that maybe we stand together against the common enemy and we invest in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel into sustainable energy and energy efficiency. So, this is a global problem, we need the whole world working together on it. And as president I would hope to provide that leadership.","It is possible for the next president to reverse the devastating effects that climate chaos has caused in our country. First and foremost, I would host, in the United States, a climate summit. The Paris Agreement will have expired, as far as our ability to get into it, but I would host, in the U.S., a summit, put us back into it and then invest in greening the grid. Solar, wind, fusion, alternative fuel cells, and storage.","I think it’s possible for the next president to make huge advances on climate change. Partly it’s about the United States’ leadership. We lead. We’re just leading in the wrong direction right now. By pulling out of the Paris climate accord, it’s not only what we’re doing here in the United States, we’re giving cover all around the world to any country that says “you know, I don’t really want to spend the money to have to make these changes so that we can help reverse climate change and reverse the negative effects of CO2 in the atmosphere.” I believe that the opportunities for the next president are enormous. We can show worldwide leadership. We can make changes right here at home with the Environmental Protection Agency and other initiatives from the government, we can change the laws. We can make a major investment in infrastructure, clean infrastructure, but also hardened infrastructure against the climate change that’s coming. There’s a lot we can do, and it not only will help us promote a cleaner America and a cleaner world, but also the kinds of investments that will help us build a more prosperous economy. So this one can be a win, win, win. We just got to start. We’ve got to have the leadership for it.","Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our generation. We have 12 years, according to most scientists, we have 12 years. If we do not act in very fundamental and very significant ways, we will cause irreparable harm to our ecosystem. So the next president of the United States needs to be someone who understands that, and who gives it the priority that it needs to have as this kind of an emergency, this kind of an urgency, not only for this country, but for the planet. We need a world-class environmentalist at the head of the E.P.A. We need the E.P.A. to be a magnet for world-class environmentalists, then sustainability experts who know that the president has their back, the full power of the executive branch of the U.S. government is at your back guys. No more apologists for the fossil fuel companies, no more leaders from the chemical companies, or oil companies in the E.P.A. We need, whether it has to do with carbon sequestration, whether it has to do with reforestation, sustainability in terms of energy, and sustainability in terms of transportation, and also a factory farming, nitrous oxide, the methane that, that brings forth. Yeah, we have a president who can absolutely ... We need a president who absolutely can cause a real shift in this situation, and I believe that with the right leadership, the American people are ready to go along.","The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded human history. Climate change is just now accelerating and scientists’ projections are unfortunately getting more and more dismal in terms of the impact of climate change that we’re already seeing in these floods and extreme weather patterns and wildfires and other phenomena here in the U.S. that have already caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage and cost many lives. So climate change is now, to me, one of the most existential threats that we face as a country. The brutal truth is that the United States of America only accounts for about 15 percent of global emissions. So even if we were to go very aggressively towards a much more renewable energy infrastructure, it would likely only slow the rate of climate change incrementally. We need to rejoin the Paris accords, implement a carbon fee and dividend, try and capture carbon and sequester it in various ways, plant millions of trees, but also prepare for the fact that climate change is likely going to be with us and is going to accelerate in the years to come. So we should be investing in ways to mitigate the worst effects including billions of dollars in renewable infrastructure, a dividend of a $1,000 a month for every American adult would make our population more resilient, more able to deal with the worst effects of climate change because when there’s a natural disaster we know it’s the poor that get hit hardest. REPORTER: Sounds like you don’t think the president can stop climate change, but that they can take steps towards combating the effects? YANG: I don’t believe that the president can put a halt to climate change, given that the United States only accounts for 15 percent of global emissions, but we can take dramatic steps to combat it, slow the progress, and mitigate the effects on our own people."
