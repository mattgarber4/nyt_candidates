"1","5"," Who is your hero, and why?","I’d say that my mom and my grandparents. They were Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust in and around Warsaw, and then after the war was over, they spent two years in Poland, then went to Stockholm for a year, then went to Mexico City for a year. They came here to New York to rebuild their shattered lives in the only country that they thought they could. And I’ve spent a lot of time traveling around my state. There are a lot of people with very heavy accents, but none has a heavier accent than my grandparents had, and I don’t know any greater patriots than they were. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? BENNET: Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln faced longer odds than any president of the United States ever has, and that we ever will — which is good news, because there’s a tendency to think that we live in a really dark time, and in some ways we do, but it’s nothing compared to what Abraham Lincoln and people like Frederick Douglass faced. Frederick Douglass, born a slave in the United States of America, fought to end slavery in his lifetime. Those guys were remarkable leaders at a remarkable time in American history, and I just think that their example is one that we need today.","My hero is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I think there’s no president who has done more, over the whole host of the years of this country, there’s no president who’s done more for working people, and who changed the society to actually favor everyday Americans, not just those who had done really well. I grew up in a family where we would have family gatherings, and I always say they talked about Franklin Roosevelt so often, you felt like there was another chair at the table. Because he meant so much to my family in all the ways that he addressed the Depression and the suffering the people were going through. They felt like the president of the United States was on their side and the federal government was on their side, and we need that again. So I look to him as an example of what was and what could be again.","Gosh, my greatest heroes are my parents. I had a family that modeled for me. I think James Baldwin said it best: “Children are never good at listening to their elders, but they never fail to imitate them.” My parents, who had jobs, who were entrepreneurs, but perhaps the biggest thing that stood out to me as a child is that they always were about service — from the stories of my parents’ activism in the civil rights movement sit-ins, to all the way to me witnessing them working on everything from fair housing, to even in retirement my mom ran an organization that dealt with homeless issues and united families. And so, service was a core value in my life because it was what was exhibited to me by my parents and my grandparents, who are truly my heroes. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? BOOKER: You know, the biggest political heroes I have are actually in my community. People that were never elected to office, but shaped the politics of our town. And so, the first person that pops into my mind when you talk about a political hero is a person who was a tenant president of the high-rise projects I lived in in Newark for about eight years, a woman named Miss Virginia Jones, who — she was very political and knew that if you fight within the political system, you can actually make lives better for people in your community. She’s actually the person that told me that I was going to run for city council, even when I kind of resisted that. So, she modeled for me a politics that’s about service and leadership that understands that you can’t lead the people if you don’t love the people.","My hero is, candidly, my wife. We’ve been together about 20 years, and we have three young kids: 17, 15 and 12. And both what she’s been able to do in making sure that even after a decade in public life, that our kids know that they’re the most important things in our lives, and being able to support me while having a career. I wouldn’t be here doing this without her. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? BULLOCK: If you look locally, there was a guy named Joe Mazurek who was attorney general when I first got engaged in public service. And Joe has since passed away, but he was someone that, every day he woke up, not about political advantage, but it was like, “What’s best to do?” And he was my mentor along the way. At a greater scale, and maybe it’s because I come from the West, if I look at presidents, well you’ve had incredible presidents over the years. Teddy Roosevelt, both what he did for public lands, what he did to make sure that everybody felt like government was about individuals, it wasn’t about the big companies. And his boldness along the way, probably from a presidential perspective.","Politically, I would go with Lincoln, because he not only held the country together, but also had a vision for the future: Laid the groundwork for the Transcontinental Railroad, set up the National Science Foundation, all while part of the country had gone to war against the other part. And it shows that you need to have vision, even or especially during existential crises. In addition to all the reasons why we already know Lincoln was great.","My mom. My mom is probably the biggest reason that I went into public service in the first place. When she was young she was a part of the old Chicano movement, the Mexican-American civil rights movement. She never held office but she ran for office for city council once when she was 23. She lost, but she stayed very active trying to push forward for women’s empowerment and Hispanic empowerment. And I grew up with that. So I grew up with my mother as a role model, believing that democratic participation was a good thing. REPORTER: This might be the same answer, but do you have a political hero? CASTRO: Cesar Chavez. I grew up reading a lot about Cesar Chavez and the farm workers movement, being inspired by his activism and the activism of Dolores Huerta and many others.","My hero is, in many ways, my wife. I think she’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met, and I feel so blessed to have her in my life, and she just has such a terrific moral compass that she just lifts me up. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? DELANEY: I think everyone has to view Abraham Lincoln as the great political hero of our country. It’s hard to compare anyone to George Washington, of course, but what Lincoln did at an incredibly difficult time in our country’s history, which was to save our nation and move us to a place where we could get past this original sin of slavery. I think it’s hard to think of anyone being more heroic at a more difficult moment in our country’s history than President Lincoln.","I’m inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King and all he did in his life to fight for justice and equality.","My grandmother is one of my heroes. She is a hero because she is the one who taught me that using your voice is important, and that grassroots activism can make a difference, and what you do with your time actually matters. She was a woman who grew up in upstate New York, very modest means, she never went to college. And she was a secretary in our State Legislature, and she’s the one who recognized that women didn’t have much of a voice in politics 75 years ago, so she asked all the women of the Legislature to participate, and all the women she knew in Albany, and they became the Women’s Democratic Club. And over time, those women became powerful, because you couldn’t get elected in Albany without the blessing of my grandmother and her lady friends, because they did all the work. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? GILLIBRAND: Oh, a political hero. Well, I have several, actually. I just wrote a children's book on the history of suffrage and I was so inspired by Harriet Tubman because she was a woman who was obviously born into slavery, had absolutely no rights. And after she escaped from slavery, instead of just living a free life, she went back into danger over and over and over again to save people. And what I noticed about her was her empathy. She said, “I've heard their cries and sighs, and seen their tears, and I would give every drop of blood in my veins to free them.” So for her it was all about empathy and absorbing the pain that people who were enslaved felt. And she didn't care what danger she went into. She went back over and over. And after slaves were freed, she continued to be an advocate for rights. She became a suffragist and she traveled all across the country speaking out until she was very, very advanced in age. And so she was a fearless person, and I really admired her fearlessness, her courage, her faith, and her empathy.","I would say my first and forever hero was my mother. REPORTER: And do you have a political hero? HARRIS: Shirley Chisholm. I mean certainly now that I’m running for president, and I think about the kind of ground that she broke, you know, her forever words: “Unbossed, unbought,” the fact that she really was a real role model, I think, to so many of us, regardless of race or gender. She just walked up to that microphone, and she took it, and she used her voice in a way that was speaking for so many people who otherwise could not be behind that microphone.","Well, my personal hero, like many people, was my mother, who was widowed twice before she was 40 and raised all four kids by herself with a flinty frugal nature but a deep love. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? HICKENLOOPER: Certainly Abraham Lincoln. I look at how he was able to bring the country together when it was probably even more divided than America is today, and how he was able to, as he said, make his enemies — defeat his enemies by making them his friends.","Well I have two. It’s my wife, Trudy, who I met when I was 15. Actually it’s three, because it’s she, and my mother and father, who were — my dad was a biology teacher, my mom was a retail clerk, and they helped revegetate meadows on the slopes of Mt. Rainier. But, No. 1 is Trudy Inslee. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? INSLEE: The American voter, who I think is going to help us restore democracy this year. And I look forward to helping them in that regard.","My hero has been my mom, and my dad, and for really the reasons that they devoted their lives to helping people. My mom was a teacher. She taught second grade until she was 70 years old. Her favorite unit was a monarch butterfly unit, and she would dress up as a monarch butterfly, with antennas and tights and a tunic, and a sign that said, “To Mexico or bust.” And my dad was a newspaper man his whole life, and really took on the causes of people that wrote in to him in his column, whether it was people that were let down by a bank or got ripped off by something, and he would take it on with humor, but he would help them. And I was so fortunate to have two parents that loved their jobs, and had a zest for life, and really had a zest for public service. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? KLOBUCHAR: My political hero would be Walter Mondale, who has been my mentor forever, since I first started in his office when he was vice president and I was an intern. And I thought I was going to do all these glamorous policy papers, but instead they assigned me to do the furniture inventory and crawl under every desk and lamp and write the serial numbers down. I learned two things. One: He was an honest man; nothing was missing. And two: Always do good, no matter what your first job is in politics. Because that was my first government job in Washington, and a U.S. senator was my second.","My wife right now. She’s an amazing partner, and the way that she has supported me in making this decision, and supported me in doing this run, even though we have a 6-month-old at home, is pretty incredible. And it certainly sets a good example for me. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? MOULTON: A political hero? Look, I mean, I look up to a lot of people. I love the way that John F. Kennedy inspired people to think about what they could do for the country, not just for themselves. Not just about what America can do for you, but you can do for the country. And I think that gets to the core of what America is all about — that we are a country that’s based on service, about striving to be better than we are.","My family; my kids; my wife, Amy; my folks are my heroes — the strongest people I’ve ever known, the most giving and courageous people I’ll ever meet. And, so, they’re my role models, my inspiration and my reason for doing this. REPORTER: And do you have a political hero? O’ROURKE: Abraham Lincoln is my political hero. He faced the toughest test this country has ever seen and brought us through.","Wow, I mean right now it’s Baker Mayfield, the quarterback of the Cleveland Browns. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? RYAN: I would say President Kennedy, probably. I grew up, I went to John F. Kennedy High School, and we kind of organized the school around him. And I think that had a big influence on me as far as public service, and that was tied to being Catholic and really aspirational and social-gospel-oriented view of the world. So I carry that with me.","I have many heroes and heroines. I would say Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is somebody who has inspired my life and my work. Not only because of his incredible leadership qualities, but the depth of his analysis and his courage in taking on a hateful establishment. And I admire him very much.","My hero I get to serve with in the U.S. Congress is John Lewis, for what he did during the civil rights movement, but also what he’s done on the issue of gun violence. He led us to the well a couple years ago after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and told us if we’re willing to cause a little bit of good trouble, that we can make a difference on the issue. So we had a sit-in for over 27 hours. He’s already done enough for our country, and he still does more and more every day, so he inspires me.","Oh, Teddy Roosevelt. REPORTER: And why? WARREN: Because Teddy Roosevelt took on the powerful. He was a trust-buster, and he did it not only to save our economy, but he also did it to save our democracy. And it worked. Now, we’ve gone up and down since then. But the idea of somebody who just stands up and says, “I’m going to fight for what’s right. I’m going to run up that hill, and I’m going to get as many people as I can to run along with me, and I’m going to make the kind of change we need to make in this country.” That’s my guy.","I suppose that my hero would be my father. Although, in another way, my mother, but really more my father. My father was a kind of magical character. He was like a cross between William Kunstler and Zorba the Greek. My father, when I came home from the seventh grade, and I said that our social studies teacher had said that if we do not fight in Vietnam, we will be fighting on the shores of Hawaii — and for those of you who are too young to remember, there was this thing called the Domino Theory that was used to sell the American people on the idea of the Vietnam War, that if we didn’t stop the communists there, that all these other countries would fall like dominoes — So when I said that, when I said that at the dinner table, that that’s what the teacher had told us, my father jumped up, and he said to my mother, “Sweetheart, get the visas, we’re going to Vietnam.” This was 1965. And my parents traipsed three kids, and we all went to Saigon, because my father wanted us to know what war is, so that, in his words, “The military industrial complex would never eat his children’s brains.” That’s who my father was. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? WILLIAMSON: My political hero would be Bobby Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Bobby Kennedy is a political hero of mine, I think because in my lifetime, when I was very young — and this was true for my generation — there were in people like Bobby Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, even though we were children, they held aloft the highest philosophical visions within a political context. They talked about the great ideas of what it meant to live on this earth as brothers, and how this could be contextualized and manifest in society. It touched me deeply then and it touches me now. FDR is ... first of all, we can talk about any political hero and say, “Well, they did some things wrong as well.” So when I say that FDR is a bit of a political hero of mine, that’s not to say I don’t realize some big mistakes that he made as well. And certainly if you talk about someone like Thomas Jefferson, I mean on one hand you’re talking about the man who wrote the Declaration of Independence, and as he himself said, “Every institution is but a shadow cast by its founder.” And he himself owned slaves. So when you look at great political figures in our history, what you admire and what you are grateful for are the principles that they bequeathed to us. That does not mean that they themselves, on a historical level in terms of their own personhood, always embodied even the principles that they themselves purported to stand for. So those principles of course are what I recognize as the genius of the mind of Jefferson. Abraham Lincoln, not only the brilliance of Lincoln, but the personal courage of Lincoln. I’m fascinated by both Roosevelt and Eisenhower and their leadership during World War II. Because what occurs to me about both of them is how sober — deeply intellectually, emotionally and psychologically sober — they were. You know, when you look at the Vietnam War and you look at Iraq war, just the recklessness, the irresponsibility, the lack of deep, deep emotional sobriety. You didn’t see that with Eisenhower or with Roosevelt. These were very, very, very serious men, both of whom hated war. And the thing about Eisenhower also — and this is often true of generals, because I’ve seen it — they’re not these reckless little boys playing with war like it’s a Lego set. So when you read about people in history who did such extraordinary things, but were themselves just human beings ... they weren’t people who didn’t have problems. They weren’t people who didn’t have issues. But they did what they needed to do. And our generation so needs to see that right now. A crisis is never convenient for a country or for an individual. But when you rise to the occasion, extraordinary things do happen.","My hero are my parents because of all the sacrifices they made for me and my brother after they came to this country as immigrants in the ‘60s. They actually didn’t come together. They met in graduate school. Well, they met, then got married and had me and my brother. REPORTER: Do you have a political hero? YANG: So I am the godfather of Teddy Roosevelt’s great-great-granddaughter — so think about that for a moment — but I’m a big fan of Teddy Roosevelt because of his leadership during a tough time for the country."
