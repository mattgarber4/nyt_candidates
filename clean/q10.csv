"1","10"," Describe the last time you were embarrassed. Why?","I’m sure it related to my children mocking me, which is the cause of most of my embarrassment. But I don’t remember. Do you remember? Oh yeah. I guess that the last time I was kind of embarrassed was after I yelled at Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate and my daughter Caroline was listening to that on TV and she said to her roommates, “Uh oh, I’ve heard that voice before.” And then, every time that a reporter wrote that mild-mannered Michael Bennet had yelled at Ted Cruz on the Senate floor, my daughters have always rolled their eyes and mocked me because they don’t think I’m mild-mannered.","I made a really big mistake and I wore cargo shorts to the gym and it happened to be a day when the media showed up. And I think my entire fashion reputation was destroyed all in the matter of minutes.","I gave an interview just like this and they asked me what my favorite music was. And for some odd reason I felt like — to give unvarnished candor. And one of these guys has the most eclectic taste and when I was going through the stuff, I was talking about Common and Chance the Rapper and I love gospel. But he went on my Spotify account — I confessed to some of the things that were very embarrassing. And then literally I left the interview, and I go, “Did I really, not only name an artist that truly would embarrass me?” But also, I think I sang a line or two on that interview, which will not happen here, folks. I’ve learned my lesson.","Anytime that I can let down my kids, I would feel certainly embarrassed. But the last time over — I’m trying to think of, even these last couple of days as I’ve launched this. I’ve been pleased with what I’ve done. REPORTER: Any particular moment come to mind either in the last couple days or with your kids? BULLOCK: Nothing in particular, immediately at least, comes to mind of the last time I was embarrassed. Maybe even when I was walking in for one of these interviews and of course had stuff all over me, and they are like, “Come on, Bullock.”","On some level, something embarrassing happens to me daily. I don’t know if it was embarrassing or just comical, but I was trying to meet a pretty senior member of the House delegation and came in with my staff and security personnel to the Capitol. And while they were checking me in I kind of stood off to the side as I usually do when they’re putting together a check in process. And the lady behind the desk just leaned in to me and said, “Are you with them?”— pointing to my staff. I said, “Yeah, I am.” She said, “Are you staff?” I said, “No.” She said, “Well you need to wear this name badge at all times.” I was like, “O.K., I promise I will.”And it was a reminder that every day you can get cut down to size in a way that’s probably pretty healthy when you find yourself on the news all the time.","I just the other day, I was in Iowa, and I think there were like one or two journalists around and I was about to go shake hands with a woman there at an event and she said, “Oh, I love what you just did with that resolution in Congress.” And it took me a second and I said, “Oh, that’s actually my brother, Joaquin. He’s the congressman.” I get confused for my brother all the time and this comes in varying forms of embarrassment for me and for the person that’s actually, you know, that thinks that I’m Joaquin. Probably about five to 10 times a day, I get confused for my brother, depending on where I am. And it’s always a little bit embarrassing because, you know, the person has to say, “Oh, I didn’t mean that.” And I have to say, “Oh, it’s O.K.” So, you know.","You know, when you run for office you feel a little embarrassed every day. So, you know, I’m sure it’s probably happened even today. I mean, look, the thing about running for president in particular, you know, you find yourself in a situation where everything you do and you say gets analyzed, and you just get used to it. You know, some of it is, you know, can be kind of embarrassing things you say or you do a flub and someone asks you a question, and you’re like, “No, I didn’t mean that.” So, I just can’t think of the last specific time I was embarrassed because part of it is you really stop getting embarrassed.","That’s a good question. Sister, help me out here. REPORTER: It’s probably something you did. SISTER: Maybe. GABBARD: It probably is. I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that.","Every day. My children embarrass me — they don’t embarrass me, I’m embarrassed because of what they call me out on, all the time. It’s a daily thing. REPORTER: What have they called you out on recently that made you embarrassed? GILLIBRAND: This morning, I’m in the shower of course, and I am listening to my podcast about the news of the day. I’m listening to — what was I listening to? The NPR one. Something first. Something like that. Anyway, I’m listening to the news, and Henry comes in steaming: “Mom, you woke me up. Why are you playing your news so loud in the morning? So I was embarrassed because I recognized yes, I was listening to my news too loudly and I of course said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” And I quickly turned it down. Yeah, I was listening to “Up First.” That’s what I was listening to.","Oh. Oh that happens, I mean, that happens on the campaign trail. You know, it could be, I don’t know, just a funny moment, or, I mean, I just think it’s so important not to take yourself too seriously. And I absolutely believe it’s really important to be able to laugh at yourself. And, you know, I do that a lot.","I was with my son, who is 16, and used a term — a phrase that was somewhat crude — and I paused and basically it was describing flatulence. And he looked at me very seriously and then looked at me with pity at the very fact that I was embarrassed. Anyway, it was a typical awkward moment that one has with one’s family. REPORTER: Do you want to say the term now? HICKENLOOPER: I was talking about farting. Anyway.","The last time I was embarrassed: When I missed a hook shot with three seconds to go against Ballard High School, causing us to lose the game. A pain that still resides deep in my breast, which is only mollified by the fact that 50 years ago this last month we won the state championship. So, we’ll have to go with both of those remembrances.","Well, when you’re running for president, literally every day something happens that makes you embarrassed, but — and that you could laugh about because you have to find some joy in this because there’s a lot of funny things that happen. So a few weeks ago, I had a Fox town hall meeting in Milwaukee. And I was rushed to get to the airport from the capital, and I got at the airport, and they said, “You can’t check your luggage” or, “You can’t bring your luggage on. You’re going to have to check it at the gate.” And I said, “O.K.,” but then I thought, “Oh, no. What if the outfit I’m going to wear on that Fox town hall, the luggage gets lost?” So right there at the gate, I took out what I was going to wear the next day — my green suitcoat, my pants — and then I thought, “Well, I better bring some underwear just in case.” So I bring on my backpack, and just literally holding all my clothes. I get on the plane. I have to shove the backpack under. I sit in my seat, and this nice guy behind me as I’m onto this Fox town hall goes, “Hey, Senator. You left something there in the aisle.” And it was my rather brightly colored underwear, and I just want to say thank you to that guy. O.K.? No one else would say anything about it, but he did, and I survived the Fox town hall.","Oh my gosh, I get embarrassed all the time. I told a joke this morning that went totally flat. People didn’t get it. I was asked — it actually has to do with burgers. I was asked what I would do in an alien invasion. And I said, “Well, you’ve got to try diplomacy first. So, you’d sit down with the aliens and have a burger and a beer.” And then if the conversation didn’t go well, you could say, “Anyway, the last aliens who visited, they’re in this burger.” So, I don’t know, that joke just didn’t go over well. People didn’t get it and I felt a little embarrassed. But look, you got to be out there. You got to be willing to put yourself out there and that means you are going to get embarrassed sometimes. That’s O.K., that’s human.","I was — well that’s when I embarrassed them. I was at my daughter’s graduation, I was making too much noise cheering her on, and I could tell that she was embarrassed. I can’t remember. I’ll come back to that one. Cynthia, will you look up the last time I was embarrassed? I mean, I can think of a small moment. Yesterday, we were having a roundtable as part of a rollout of our immigration plan, and there were 20 extraordinary people from the El Paso community, immigration advocates, immigrants, former service members who enlisted while they were greencard holders, but had not yet become citizens. And in the middle of this really engaging, important conversation, I knocked over a bottle of water that was set on the ground before me, and was embarrassed that I had done that. That was literally the last time I was embarrassed.","You know if you call somebody by the wrong name — that sucks. I did that a few weeks ago. That was bad. REPORTER: Who was it? RYAN: Not telling. REPORTER: Was it one of your colleagues? RYAN: No, no — a person who I should have remembered.","I get embarrassed every day when I don’t do things. I have high expectations of myself and others, and too often I don’t fulfill my own expectations.","My wife told a story a couple days ago. A couple nights ago, I woke up in the middle of the night, I thought there were gunshots outside, and started running around the room and told my wife to get down and then I went into our kids room. And she’s like, “What are you doing?” And it was just fireworks and I was, like, in the middle of my sleep and she told that story to a bunch of our friends. And it was really embarrassing when she, like, explained out loud how silly and ridiculous I looked. They were just fireworks. Just wanted to protect the kids. I’ll be more careful next time.","Recently, in a photo line. I almost always, when I see a little girl come through, stop and say, “Hi. My name is Elizabeth. I’m running for president because that’s what girls do. And a lot of times we’ll do pinkie promises to remember that. And I did this with a child and said something about, you know, “It’s really important that we girls stick together.” And the mother said, “He’s a boy.” Ouch.","The last time I was embarrassed — the last time I was embarrassed, and why. I think right now because I’m kind of embarrassed. Because I don’t know what it is. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know the last time I was embarrassed and why.","I was embarrassed just the other day because I’m running for president. There are a lot of embarrassing things that happen to you on the trail. So if you ask me like the very last thing, I was just on, you know, on the street with someone and then someone wanted a picture and I was like, “Sure.” And then I went to their friend and was like, “Do you want a picture?” And there was like this awkwardness. And they were like, “Do you want me to want a picture?” And then I was like, “Well I’m not like going to impose on you.” And the whole thing was quite awkward. That sort of thing happens every day on the trail. It’s quite embarrassing running for president."
