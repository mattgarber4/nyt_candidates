"1","2"," Would your focus be improving the Affordable Care Act or replacing it with single payer?","I think that we should finish the work that we started with the Affordable Care Act by having a robust public option for people to have the alternative to buy something other than private insurance. My plan, Medicare X, would be administered by Medicare and be available to everybody in America who wants to make a change. I think that is the way we'll get to universal coverage fastest.","We have to go a lot farther when it comes to health care. I want to see a universal health care system, just like we're doing here in New York City, where we're now guaranteeing health care for everyone who doesn't have health insurance. Look, it's so clear to me, when I talk to everyday people around this country, so many of them don't have health insurance. A lot of them that do have health insurance, they can't use it. They've got the premiums and the deductibles and the co-pays and the out-of-pocket expenses, and it becomes health insurance that's no longer workable. A lot of folks don't seek health care because it's too hard to navigate or there's too many hidden costs. And a lot of folks who even have insurance, if, God forbid, they have a serious medical problem, it can throw their whole family for a loop, their whole budget for a loop. So, look, what we have now is just not enough of a health care system. It's also a health care system that only addresses physical health most of the time. It doesn't even pay any attention to mental health, and mental health is a huge challenge for most American families. So look, I say, in the end, we need a universal health care system. I think the “Medicare for all” model is the pathway that gets us there. But we cannot continue on the current path we're on because what this means is, some people get health care and a lot of folks don't.","I don't see ... I don't see in any way that those two are mutually exclusive. I think the first thing a president needs to do when they get in office is stop the vandalism and the sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, to stabilize it. What we've seen is from a height of the Obama era, where you had expanded access, now we're seeing that access start to decline and costs going back up. And so, the first things I'll do is to stop that sabotage, is re-turn on some of the payments that were helping to stabilize it. Helping more people to sign up, because we actually took money away from even those efforts to try to get more people to sign up in the marketplaces. In addition to that, though, I'm going to fight to try to expand access through things like creating a more vibrant, robust public option. I think we need to move down Medicare eligibility, for example, as our way to move towards having everyone have access to public option, and, I think, everyone having access to health care. As a former chief executive, I know you can't hold hostage progress for some ideological purity. We need to work towards those goals, that's why I will fight for Medicare for all, but in the early days of my presidency, my day-to-day work is to get more and more people access to health care. Because every single person or family that gets access, it makes transformative changes in their lives. And so, I will do what's necessary, every day, to get more people access to health care and to lower costs for everyone.","My focus would be building off of the Affordable Care Act and improving it. And what I've seen and what I've done — the last two and a half years we've had an assault in Washington, D.C., on things like pre-existing conditions, even costs when it comes to health care. In Montana, I focused on ... everyone should have access and health care should be affordable, affordable both for the individual and, indeed, for the federal government. And I think we can get to access and affordability without disrupting 150-plus million people that have private insurance right now with access to a public option, automatic enrollment. There's about 14 million people right now that could qualify for either subsidies or Medicaid expansion, but don't. Negotiating prescription drug prices. Ending surprise billing and out-of-network billing. In a state like ours, even with a 60 percent Republican legislature, just by expanding Medicaid, we not only gave 10 percent of our population health care that didn't have it, but of that 100,000, 30,000 are now getting mental health care, 10,000 substance use disorder treatment. Everyone should be able to have access to affordable care. And there's a lot of ways to get there.","I think we need to move toward single-payer. And the way I've proposed to do it is a kind of “Medicare for all who want it.” It's an option, a version of Medicare, made available for people to buy into. Now, that's going to take a little while to kick in, so we shouldn't waste any time shoring up the A.C.A. I just don't think that it's enough for the long run. REPORTER: And what about the short term? BUTTIGIEG: In the short term, we need to stop the assault on the A.C.A. That's what this administration is undertaking right now. They may claim that they're not trying to take away, for example, your pre-existing condition coverage, but that's flatly untrue, at a moment when this administration is seeking to dismantle the A.C.A. in its entirety. We need to shore up what we have, but it's also an example of why we need universal health care, so that they can never successfully mount an attack like this again. Because they would not frontally attack universal health care enjoyed by so many Americans when it's fully up and running.","We need a new system. I grew up with a grandmother who had diabetes. As I grew older and she grew older, her condition got worse and worse until eventually, before she passed away, she had to have one of her feet amputated. But we were fortunate that she had Medicare. I want to make sure that Medicare is there for everybody in this country.","I think both, because I think what we should do right away is improve the Affordable Care Act, and then I think we should begin the conversation with the American people about how we create universal health care. I don't believe a single-payer system is the right way to create a universal health care system. I think there are better ways, I think I have a better way of creating a universal health care system, which is to give everyone health care as a right of citizenship, from when they were born to they’re 65, then when they're over 65, they go into Medicare. But, as part of getting your basic government health care, you can opt out of it if you want, and get a small tax credit and then use that to buy your own health care, or you can buy supplemental programs like folks do in Medicare. What I envision is a basic government market as a right that everyone gets as a part of citizenship, and then there be a robust private market that kind of floats on top of that. I think that's a much better market because I think it gives the American people choice, and I also think it leads to higher-quality health care and more access to health care. Because the problem I have with the single-payer system is that there's no evidence that the government actually ever pays enough for health care. Because right now, the government only pays 80 percent of the costs for Medicaid. It pays 95 percent of costs for Medicare. And private insurance pays about 115 or 120 percent of cost. So if the government were the only payer in health care, it's not clear to me that they’d ever pay costs, because we have ample evidence to suggest they won't, and that will lead to a reduction in quality and in access. So what I favor is fixing the Affordable Care Act. I want to do that in my first hundred days as president, because I think it was a good law and I think there's things to do to shore it up and make it better for the American people. But then I want to begin a discussion about how we create universal health care so that every American has health care as a right, because I think it is a basic human right, and I also think it's smart economic policy. I was an entrepreneur. I would have never been able to start my business but for the fact that my wife was working and she had health care at her job. So many Americans are shackled to their job because of health care. I want to kind of liberate them in many ways. If they want to start a business, great. If they want to get more skills and try to get a better job, terrific. I don't want them to be stuck in their job because of health care.","I support “Medicare for all.” I think the current system that we have continues to be broken even with the advances made in the Affordable Care Act. There are still far too many people in this country who are uninsured or who are underinsured and ultimately are not able to get the care that they need.","I believe in “Medicare for all” because I think health care is a right and not a privilege, and one of the challenges we've had with the A.C.A. is, we never got to universal coverage that was affordable. So I think the best way to do that is through “Medicare for all” and ultimately having a single-payer that is an earned benefit just like Social Security today, where everyone buys in at a price they can afford, matched by their employer, and you buy in your whole life.","Well, I don't think we have to accept that false choice. Let's first agree that the Affordable Care Act took us to a place where tens of millions of people for the first time had access to health care. And it was revolutionary, frankly, what they were able to achieve in terms of improving and reforming the health care system. I think we now need to take it to the next step, because still in our country, so many people do not have access to affordable health care. My goal, and I think the best place that we could be, is to have “Medicare for all.” And I support “Medicare for all.” And the other part of it is that we have to have policies in our country that recognize that one of the biggest barriers — in fact, the biggest barrier — to everyone having access to health care is cost. And we have got to be focused on reducing, and in some situations eliminating, the cost. Public health should be an issue that is not a political issue. We should know that access to health care should be a right, and not a privilege for those who can afford it, and I support everything that we need to do to get to a place where people don't have to make decisions about whether they can relieve their pain or receive access to health care based on how much money they have.","I think the first thing that most Democrats agree on is that we need to get to universal health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege. Then you have to decide what the best way to get to universal coverage is. And I think once we get the White House and get Congress, we could get universal coverage and adjust. If we're going to go to Medicare for all, right now there's 160, 165 million people that have private insurance mostly through their business. More than two-thirds of those people are happy or very happy with the insurance they have. They're not going to want to give it up. I think any transition has to recognize that those people who have a health care system that works for them should be accommodated, and that the new system should allow a smooth transition for everybody. REPORTER: Is there a very short version of that, that we could use? Sort of like “improve it or replace it”? HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think we need universal coverage. Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and to get there, we're going to need a lot of the systems that are in place now, but we're going to have to enhance them in significant ways.","I would move forward with the success we've had in Washington, and I'm proud that we had the first public option in the United States. And now we need universal health care. And that means moving forward with Medicare for all who want it, reducing the age of eligibility, and helping more people get health care like we've done in the state of Washington. REPORTER: That sounds like replacing it with universal health care is then your stance? INSLEE: We need universal health care in the United States, we need to build on my success as the first governor to adopt a public option and move to a “Medicare for all who want it” program. I believe that's the future for health care in America.","My focus would be building on the Affordable Care Act. The first thing we have to do is to protect it from the Republicans, who are trying to kick people off their insurance if they have pre-existing conditions. They just filed a brief down in a case in Texas where they are basically trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So we need to keep it in place, but it is a beginning and not an end. I would work immediately to bring premiums down and to expand health care to universal access. How do you do it? Well, first you do it with something called reinsurance and cost-sharing that I think could pass very quickly, and then you have a public option so that people can choose. Maybe you could do it with Medicaid, ou could do it with Medicare, so that they have an option where there's not a lot of middlemen making money off of them. And then, finally, the Affordable Care Act did not do enough when it came to pharmaceutical prices. I would take on pharma big time. They have two lobbyists for every member of Congress. They think they own Washington, but they don't own me. For years, I've been leading the bills for negotiation for Medicare prices, for bringing less expensive drugs in from places like Canada that are safe, and also for stopping the horrendous practice where pharma pays off their competitors, generic companies, to keep their products off the market. That's wrong, and when I am president, we will get these bills done.","My focus would be on improving the Affordable Care Act, but we need to make some significant improvements, because there are a lot of people who still do not have access to quality, affordable health care. I think I'll be the only person in this race who gets single-payer health care, because I made a commitment to continue getting my own health care at the VA when I was elected to Congress. And the fact of the matter is that it's a far from perfect system. I've seen firsthand some of the challenges with the single-payer system. So, I think health care is a right. I think everybody in America deserves access to health care. If that means Medicare, or, even better, a successor to Medicare that everybody can have for free if they want it, that is great. But I'm not going to force people to get rid of their private health care plans if they like them.","My focus is on ensuring that we have guaranteed high-quality health care for every single American, that it is universal for every child, for every woman, for every man in this country. We can begin by improving the Affordable Care Act, but we have to go far beyond that. The plan that I am supporting is “Medicare for America,” that guarantees that everyone who does not have care today is able to enroll in Medicare. Those who have insufficient health care, meaning they can't afford their premiums, or bridge their deductibles, or make the co-pay on their prescription medications or their doctors’ visits, they can choose to enroll in Medicare as well. And those who have employer-sponsored insurance that they like, because it works for them and their families, are able to keep that as well. That is the surest, quickest path to guaranteeing that everybody has high-quality care in the United States.","We need to move towards a single-payer system. I think the natural next step is to have some public option for people to be able to buy affordable, accessible, quality health care. We tried really hard during the Obamacare debates to get the public option in. I think that is the natural next step for us to take.","The United States today is the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. Our current system is dysfunctional. It leaves 34 million people uninsured and even more underinsured. We pay the highest prices in the world by far for prescription drugs, and at the end of all of that we spend twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other nation. This system is not working. Clearly we need to replace it with a popular system, and that is Medicare, and expand Medicare to all. So, I believe in a “Medicare for all,” single-payer program.","As president, I will seek a coverage-for-all system that says if you're sick, you're seen, if you're seen, you won't go broke. It would be a public option to drive down the prices in the private insurance market, but also to strive to find cures in our lifetime. To invest public dollars in genomics, targeted therapies and data sharing as a way to increase the quality of life, decrease the costs, and create a lot of new jobs in the meantime. REPORTER: So, fair to say you would not be a “blow it up and replace it” kind of guy? SWALWELL: I'm a coverage-for-all candidate, so I want every person who needs coverage to be able to get it through the government if that's the option they choose. If you want","Yes, look, and in fact, I'd be focused on three things. The first is, we need to defend the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans are still attacking it — lawsuit down in Texas, HHS is doing everything they can to take the legs out of it. Second thing we need to do: We need to pick off the things that are easy, reduce the cost of prescription drugs. I've got a bill to reduce the cost of generic drugs. We need a consumers’ bill of rights for insurance, private insurance, so that people don't get ripped off. Same kind of deal I set up for credit card companies. That's part two. And part three, we’ve got to keep moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost. And there are a lot of different ways to get there. “Medicare for all” has a lot of different paths for how we get there. But ultimately it's about making sure that we all adhere to the basic principle. Health care is a basic human right. It is our collective responsibility to make sure everybody gets coverage at the lowest possible cost. And Medicare: best way to get there.","I think the wisest thing for us to do is to have a “Medicare for all”-type plan as a public option, and then to give people the opportunity also to keep their private insurance, if they want it. I know there are a lot of people who disagree with that, who feel that we need to just go straight on, all “Medicare for all,” nothing else, right away. But, for myself, as president, I want to be an agent of change, but not an agent of chaos. And I believe that even though we need to definitely navigate some fundamental shifts, fundamental pattern disruptions to the economic and political status quo in this country, we want to do so carefully, and causing as little personal disruption for people as possible. REPORTER: That sounds a bit like, sort of somewhere in the middle. WILLIAMSON: It's a Medicare ... Definitely, definitely, the issue here is to have universal health coverage for every single American.","My focus would be on replacing it with “Medicare for all,” a system that provides health care to all Americans. I think that the Affordable Care Act was a tremendous step forward, but did not go quite far enough."
