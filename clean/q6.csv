"1","6"," Would there be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of your first term?","No. REPORTER: Do you want to elaborate at all? BENNET: If we’re there for another couple of years in Afghanistan, we’ll have been there for 20 years. If you’re a kid in college or you’re 18 or 19 years old, you’ve only known us being at war. We’ve spent $5.6 trillion in the Middle East. It’s time for us to come home from Afghanistan.","Well I have spent a lot of time with families who lost their loved ones in Afghanistan and it is a war that has gone on too long. We have to make sure there is a peace settlement in Afghanistan; it obviously has to involve the Taliban. Until that point, I don’t think it’s sensible to take out our troops. But we hope for the day where there’s some kind of peace that at least allows us to have much less of a presence in Afghanistan, maybe even one day to remove all of our troops. REPORTER: That sounds like a “yes, if it’s feasible” but you don’t really think it’s feasible. DE BLASIO: You want me to do that? REPORTER: Yeah I want a yes or no. DE BLASIO: No, I’m saying …. Some things, my friend, I think you would agree, are not always a yes or a no. REPORTER: Right but we want them to be. DE BLASIO: But they aren’t. I would say so ... yes, if it’s possible to forge a real peace plan in Afghanistan that’s durable, the ideal, of course, would be to remove all U.S. troops. But even if we could get a more stable situation that would allow for fewer troops to be there, that would be a huge step forward.","No, we need to bring our American troops home. We cannot have forever wars in this nation, and this is one area where I’m going to be determined to bring American troops home. But I think it’s a mistake in presidential campaigns to start putting out timelines for our military. I think there’s a lot of irresponsibility in that, when you need to negotiate our troops coming home under the right terms and right circumstances, and not in a way that’s going to mandate future interventions in the future. So, my driving force will be to bring our troops home safe and sound, under the conditions that will lead toward peace and security in that region. This is not something that I take lightly, when you have American troops on the front lines, at risk. We’ve seen military individuals and their families making incredible sacrifices for this country. I’ll bring those troops home and I’ll do it the right way.","You know, we’ve been 18, 19 years in Afghanistan now. Think about somebody joining the military right now — Afghanistan and the conflict has been going on for their entire life. Even as governor, I went over to Afghanistan in 2013. And talking to both military leaders and in the diplomatic corps, the discussion was: It’s time to get out, it’s time to let this country go forward. I think what we ultimately need to do is not only remove the troops, but if we’re gutting our diplomatic efforts as this administration has been putting less in the State Department, it’s going to be that much harder for stability.","No. Maybe whatever is needed to prevent attacks on the homeland, as we do around the world through the right kind of special operations and intelligence presence. But you’re not going to see what we have today. When I left Afghanistan in 2014, I thought I was one of the last people turning out the lights. Five years later, we’re still there. And you can now be old enough to be deployed to Afghanistan, and not even have been alive on 9/11. We’ve got to put an end to endless war globally. And when it comes to Afghanistan, one thing that everybody can agree on is that we’re getting out. The hard part is figuring out whether we can get out well, or whether we’re going to get out poorly. And one of my top priorities is to make sure our departure goes well for America, if this administration fails to bring that conflict to a close.","No. I recognize, like a lot of people, that we do need to withdraw from our engagements there. The question is how we do that. I disagree with this administration’s haphazard way of announcing and going about withdrawal. We need to withdraw in a way that is orderly, that respects our allies, that leaves the region as stable as we possibly can, given the circumstances.","I’m like most Americans, I want to get our troops out of Afghanistan, I want to get our troops out of Syria, I want to get our troops out of Iraq. But I want to do it when we’ve accomplished, effectively, the goals that are in the best interest of the American people. As it relates to Afghanistan, I would like to get our troops out of Afghanistan, except for a very small contingent of American troops who would be left there to, effectively, train security forces. That’s really what I would view as a successful goal for troop withdrawal out of Afghanistan at this point. REPORTER: So yes, but very minimally? DELANEY: Very minimal. I would basically provide the same answer for Iraq and Syria. I think the goals are a little different. In Syria, we have to make sure our allies, the Kurds, are somehow taken care of, that they’re settled in a region, probably not on the Turkish border. We have to make sure Iran doesn’t have a presence on the Israeli border. We have to make sure that ISIS is actually fully defeated. So our goals there are a little different. Our goals with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan, I think, are to ensure that there’s not terrorism. At the end of the day, the reason we’re in all these countries, fundamentally, was about the fact that we thought there was a terror risk to the United States of America and our citizens. We went there for those reasons, and I wouldn’t want to leave until I felt like that risk didn’t exist. I think realistically, with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan, we should expect there to be very significant troop withdrawal from those two countries. But we should also realistically acknowledge that it’s in our self-interest as a country to keep a small presence there to training local security and law enforcement in those countries to make sure they’re doing the things they need to do to combat terror, because that’s in our self-interest.","There will not be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of my first term. REPORTER: Could you expand on that? Just why? GABBARD: Our country has been at war in Afghanistan for far too long, creating a great cost to our troops and to the American people, leaving us and the Afghan people no better off than we were before. First of all, I’m a soldier, I’ve served over 16 years in the Army National Guard, in Congress over six years on both the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees. I’ve deployed twice to the Middle East and I know firsthand the cost of war. We’ve got to take on the threats to our national security, threats like Al Qaeda and ISIS, and defeat those threats. And as president, I will end the wasteful regime-change wars that have taken such a toll on our troops and on the American people, with the trillions of dollars that we’ve spent on these wars. Dollars that we need to invest in things like health care, infrastructure, education and so much more.","I believe that we need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. I think if we want to have long-term troop engagements in those countries, we need to have a new A.U.M.F., an authorization for use of military force. The ones that we passed immediately after 9/11, I don’t believe — are no longer appropriate for what we are doing across the Middle East. I think the troops particularly in Syria should be drawn down. I don’t think we have true authorization for combat operations there, and I believe that if we are going to engage in anti-terrorism, it should be far more targeted. If we need to engage in stability operations, that should be something that Congress, again, opines on, and authorizes military force.","I believe we should bring back our troops from Afghanistan, but I also believe that we need to have a presence there in terms of supporting what the leaders of Afghanistan want to do in terms of having peace in that region, and certainly suppressing any possibility of ISIS or any other terrorist organization from gaining any steam. REPORTER: So maybe a small presence? HARRIS: I think the question is the type of presence, right? And as we have done in the past, I think that it is completely appropriate that we would give support to the Afghan government in terms of helping them train their troops and thinking about how we can provide assistance so that they can have their own people up and running in a way that they keep their country secure, and in particular, prevent it from becoming a haven, or returning to being a haven, for terrorists who ultimately could obviously attack our country.","If there were troops there, there’d be very few. I think that as we go forward, we need to look around the world and perhaps put a sharper focus on what are the benefits we get from our military deployments. But Afghanistan might still have some troops in it.","Not in any sizable number. We have to change our foreign policy to stop this mirage that we can rebuild whole countries and cultures. If we do have any remaining forces, it would be Special Forces to protect against terrorist activities. But it is time to do what I’ve said when I was against the Iraq war. I now believe we should bring our troops home from Afghanistan, and we should speak up very vocally against what Donald Trump and John Bolton are trying to do, which is to set the stage for another war in Iran, just like they did in the war against Iraq. We need to stop that today.","No. I think we need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We have been there longer than some of our young people have been on this earth, and it is time to work with the government there and, again, with our allies -- we don’t want to do this alone — to make sure that the government remains there strong. But it is time to bring our troops home.","If there were, they’d be there with a clear mission to prevent terror attacks and that’s it. I’m sorry, but we’ve got to abandon nation-building in Afghanistan, it just hasn’t worked. And we’ve got to be cleareyed about what the troops are there to do. We also can’t just withdraw them so quickly, without a plan, that they have to go back. Because that’s the mistake we made with Iraq, is that we withdrew the troops so quickly that we had to send them back. I want to bring the troops home from the Middle East more than anyone, having spent so much time there myself, but I want to make sure they can come home for good and not have to go back on my watch.","There would not. We need to end the wars that began, in the case of Afghanistan, nearly 18 years ago. In the case of Iraq, nearly 28 years ago. Bring these service members back to their home country, to their communities, support them as they transition into civilian life. We have to decide that we will not achieve our foreign policy goals on the backs of 18- and 19- and 20-year-old service members who are deployed in dozens of countries, half a world away right now. We have to begin to bring these wars to a close, and address legitimate foreign policy concerns and goals through our diplomacy, and through working with other countries in the region.","Well, I’d have to look at the circumstances, but it’d probably be very limited. I do worry about leaving these safe-havens for terrorists to plot attacks, and I think we do have to have, at least with an international coalition, be a part of making sure that these attacks can’t be planned in some of these safe-havens. We just saw in Sri Lanka the other day, there are still people in the world who want to do bad things. I don’t think — you know, I was against the war in Iraq — don’t think we need to have a huge presence, but we do need to recognize that we have some responsibility to prevent things from happening in our own country.","I suspect not. I think that we would work as aggressively as we can with our allies in the region to end the endless wars that we have been participating in. I fear very much, and doing everything I can to get the United States now out of the horrific war in Yemen, and to do everything I can to make sure that Trump doesn’t get us into a war with Iran. So to answer your question, I think by the end of my first term, our troops would be home.","I will seek to pull out American troops from Afghanistan who are not there to train and equip or provide security at our embassy, but I do think we need to reduce the presence. I think Congress needs to vote on a new use of military force. That’s Congress’s role, to define what I call the three T’s: the time that we’re going to be there; the number of troops we’re going to have on the ground, and whether those troops include only U.S. troops or require allies to be a part of it, too; and the terrain covered, whether the authorization extends only to Afghanistan, or other parts of the globe. We’ve seen Congress unwilling to do that and the president unwilling to ask, and I would ask Congress immediately to redefine our role in Afghanistan. REPORTER: Is it fair to say that your answer is “yes, but very few,” that there would be American troops? SWALWELL: As president, I would significantly reduce the troop level in Afghanistan. We want to protect the embassy we have there. There are still Afghan army forces that we want to train and equip, so they can defend their own country, but I think we should shift largely to supporting them economically so that they can stand themselves up, give their people opportunity, make sure it’s an equal-opportunity country where men and women are able to compete. That’s the best hope for Afghanistan’s future.","","As president of the United States, I would make no move in Afghanistan until first I spoke to Afghan women. I want to hear from the Afghani women. I’m very aware of the history of the Taliban in relationship to women, and so nothing happens until first I talk to them.","My hope would be that there would be no American troops in Afghanistan at the end of my first term, but it’s impossible to know that for sure, given that reality on the ground might lead us to have to have people there if we can accomplish goals in that timeframe."
