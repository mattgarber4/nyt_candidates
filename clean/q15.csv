"1","15"," When did your family first arrive in the United States, and how?","When I was in the second grade, we were asked to line up in order of whose family had been in the country the longest and whose family had been in the country the shortest. And I was the answer to both questions. My mom had recently arrived, when she was 10 years old, as a Polish Jew who had survived the Holocaust. My dad’s family had been here since the Mayflower came to the United States, or what was then America — what was then not even America.","I’ve got a tale of two sides in my family and two very different stories. One half of my family came very early on in the history of this country. Folks who were here, literally, in the first decades of the European settlement of the United States. My family’s proud of that history, and it’s part of the lore I’ve heard at family gatherings about our ancestors who were here from the very beginning. But the other side of my family, my mom’s side, comes from Southern Italy. And I’ve been to the two towns that my grandparents come from. My grandfather Giovanni and my grandmother Anna, they come from really small towns, mountain towns in southern Italy, about the farthest thing you could imagine from New York City. And each of them came here not speaking English, only having a few family members here already in New York, not having any amazing skill that they could bring and make money right away. They came here because, at that point in Southern Italy, there was very little opportunity, and they came here hoping they could do something different. And they literally live the American dream. They met here in New York, they had three daughters, and all of them, including my mom, went to college, both from parents who never even got close to going to college. So we’ve experienced that extraordinary American immigrant experience on that side of the family. I’m the second generation born here in America. My mom spoke Italian before she spoke English, and yet, she was able to go to Smith College and have a professional career. We’ve lived that American dream, and it’s beautiful. And we’ve got to keep it now. We’ve got to protect it because it’s not happening for a lot of people now. So many new immigrants are not being treated with the respect they deserve, and I draw from that very, very deeply. I know that my own grandfather, who I knew well and I loved very deeply, I know that in some of the way you’re hearing immigration talked about today — when Arizona had those laws calling for law enforcement to single out people who might be immigrants — my grandfather in his time would have been one of those, obviously, with a thick accent, and a different look from Southern Italy. And it would’ve been 100 percent clear that he wasn’t from here. And yet, he was as exemplary a person as you could imagine and he did so much for his family and he loved this country, and that’s part of what animates me to respect all immigrants today.","I was really privileged to be a part of a show called “Finding Your Roots.” A little embarrassing, because they do it in tandem, and it was done with me and John Lewis, and I knew there was going to be problems when they opened the show with the biographies of two people. And it starts off by: “John Lewis, hero of the civil rights movement, standing on the Edmond Pettus Bridge, he literally bled the Southern soil red for freedom.” And then it goes to Cory Booker: “Cory Booker, growing up in suburban New Jersey, riding his big wheel.” I mean, the comparison is outrageous. I was always taught that I stand on the shoulders of giants, and when Henry Louis Gates, Dr. Gates, did that analysis of my history, it blew me away to see my roots. To see that I am the descendant of slaves, of people that were born from a slave and a slave master. To see that my ancestry goes back to before the founding of this country. He found one branch of my tree, I am a direct descendant of people who came here from England in 1640. And so, when I saw where my family tree and where my roots go, to every imaginable corner of our country, I was profoundly humbled to know that from slaves and slave owners, from people stolen from Africa, to people who came here centuries before this nation, over a century before this nation was founded, it made me even more deeply proud and feeling even more deeply connected to this country’s history, and more importantly to the urgent call that I have, knowing I can’t pay my ancestors back for all the struggle, all the sacrifice, all the survival under conditions that were unimaginable. That the only choice I have right now to honor our history is by paying those blessings forward.","I should know that, and I don’t know. I know that the family history is probably not as solid ... and I know that on my mother’s side, I think her great-great-grandfather settled in Henry County in Iowa. On my father’s side, I’m not sure where.","My dad came to this country in the ’70s. He stepped off an airplane at J.F.K. He said it was such a chaotic and intimidating scene that he briefly thought about getting right back on a plane and heading home. But he had come to this country for an education. He knew it was the best place in the world to study, and became a graduate student, and then became an American citizen. My mom’s people go, I think, way back. Scots-Irish folks who settled in Southern Indiana. And they met in New Mexico when they were both teaching out there.","Well I grew up with my mother and my grandmother. And my grandmother, her name was Victoria Castro. She came to the United States when she was 7 years old with her little sister. They came from Mexico because their parents had died. And so she ended up living on the west side of San Antonio and raised my mom as a single parent. She was a wonderful woman. Worked her life as a maid, a cook and a babysitter because she never finished elementary school. That’s on my mom’s side. On my father’s side, his relatives had come over from Mexico at the turn of the century in about the year 1900.","If you go back and think about my grandparents on my father’s side, my grandfather’s name was obviously Delaney, but my grandmother’s name was Barlow. And on my mother’s side, they were Rowe and Lynch ... so I’m three-quarters Irish and one-quarter English. My grandfather came here — on my mother’s side, this is my grandfather who was from England — he came here in 1923, and he immigrated here from England with his seven brothers and sisters. They came on a ship .... It was interesting when I went back and read about their journey here, the day they came to New York, they came on one of 15 ships who pulled into New York Harbor, delivering 15,000 immigrants on just one day. And he came with his seven brothers and sisters and his mother, but he was actually detained when they were coming in. So, his seven brothers and sisters were let in, his mother was let in, but he was detained. The reason he was detained, is because he only had one arm. So they basically sent him to Staten Island, he was going to be deported, but his family got him an appeal. The appeal was held in the Great Hall of Ellis Island, he was a little boy, he only had one arm. He had lost his arm in England when he was a boy because he was playing in a field with a World War I shell that had not exploded until he played with it, and then it exploded, and that’s how he lost his arm. So while he was waiting to get his appeal, the judge walked in who was hearing these appeals. And my grandfather saw that the judge also had one arm, and that was the only reason he was let into this country, because the one-armed judge basically ignored the rules. The rules were back then, we didn’t let people into this country who had a disability, because we wanted able-bodied men and women, and in their eyes, they thought people with disabilities didn’t meet that standard. He was only let into this country because he happened to have a one-armed judge who saw the one-armed boy and told him to go make something of his life. So that’s the story of how my grandfather got here. Then he ended up working in a pencil factory in Jersey City, New Jersey. My grandfather on my father’s side, he was a dock worker in Jersey City, New Jersey, so most of my family is from Jersey City. I grew up in a town called Wood-Ridge, which is not far from Jersey City. That’s where my parents settled, and so that’s a little bit about my grandparents.","My mom is from Michigan and my dad is born in American Samoa, and our family moved to Hawaii when I was 2 years old. REPORTER: And where was your mom’s family way back before they were in Michigan? GABBARD: Way back, my mom’s family came from different parts of Europe and my father’s family came from New Zealand and also different parts of Europe.","On my mother’s side, her parents were from Ireland and Scotland, and they came probably four generations ago. My father’s side, his mother and father were from Eastern European countries. Places like Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany. And they came probably four generations ago, too. So my parents’ parents were born here, but their parents, some of them may have been born abroad.","Well, my parents arrived in the late 1950s. My mother came from India to go to the University of California, Berkeley, to study science.","","I don’t know how my family first arrived. We have some lineage that goes back to England and Wales, and beyond that, the path is murky. And we’ve been very fortunate as a family, I’ve been very fortunate to have a great family, and I’m looking forward to having several more generations of Inslees — if we defeat climate crisis. The Inslees stand strong against that climate crisis.","Well, my family arrived over a century ago on the Slovenian side, my dad’s side, that came over to work in the mines in Northern Minnesota. It was not a easy life, but they did it because they thought it would be better for their next generations to come, and it was. On my mom’s side, it’s actually the most interesting. My grandparents came over directly from Switzerland. My mom, when she was a little girl — or, my grandma, when she was a little girl, and then my grandpa when he was around 18 years old. And he came through Ellis Island, and they had met the quota on Swiss immigrants, so he said he was going to Canada. He just stayed there a week, and he somehow found his way into Wisconsin, where he met my grandma and married her. But what was really interesting is the whole time, for decades, he remained an alien. And right before World War II, they made aliens register, because they were looking for communists. And he registered, and they asked what organizations he belonged in, and he said, “The Swiss Male Choir,” so he got registered as an alien, and then he decided he wanted to try to be a citizen. That’s when they found out about the fact that he had entered our country twice and he hadn’t really stayed in Canada. There was a hearing and they allowed him to stay, and he became a citizen just a few weeks before we entered World War II. And I have this picture of him smiling with his bow tie on, and I often look at that photo of my grandpa, and I think, “What would have happened to him now? Would he have been deported, like so many people are in this country, when he was just trying to make a life for his family, and raise my mom and her brother?” Probably, and then I wouldn’t be a U.S. senator. And it’s one of the reasons that I fight every day for immigration reform.","So, we’re an immigrant family from the early 1600s, so we’ve been here a while. My dad’s side came from England around the 1630s, and I think my mom’s side, the Meader family, came a little bit later, also from England. They both ended up around southern New Hampshire, so very much a New England family from the start. REPORTER: You don’t have any ancestors in Iowa or South Carolina, do you? MOULTON: I’m sure we’ll find them in this process if I do.","Well there are lots of different family members who proceeded me, depending on how many generations you go back, but I know that the O’Rourkes came from Ireland in the 19th century. There are family members on my mom’s side who came 100 years before that. But I’d like to think that my family members are part of a long tradition in this country of welcoming immigrants and asylum-seekers and refugees from the world over. The fact that this country is founded on the basis not of race, or ethnicity, or common ancestry, but this idea that we were all created equal. The idea being to equal opportunity, and an ability to make this the greatest country on the face of the planet, because we are a country of the people of the planet, who have found a home here. So my story, perhaps not unlike many other people’s stories, begins with those first immigrants who arrived here in this country.","My dad’s side, my Irish side, got to the United States in 1829, I believe, through Philadelphia. And my mom’s side — she’s a hundred percent Italian — her maternal grandmother came in the early 1900s. My grandfather’s family came in right around then too, early 1900s, like 1910, 1912. His family came from Calabria in Italy, and my grandmother’s family came from Basilicata in Italy, just a little bit north of Calabria.","My father came to this country when he was 17 years of age. I am not quite sure of the year right now, probably give or take around 1920, I don’t have that in my head right now. My mother’s family came some years earlier. My mother’s family came from Russia. My father’s family came from Poland. And when we talk about the fact that I am the son of an immigrant, I am somewhat sensitive to the issue of immigration and immigration reform, and the kind of ugly attacks that we’re seeing right now on the immigrant community.","The Swalwell side of my family came to the United States just at the turn of the 20th century. They came from England. My mother’s family came from Denmark. My parents were both born — my dad was born in the San Francisco Bay Area and my mom was born in South Dakota. REPORTER: What brought them here to begin with? SWALWELL: I don’t know too much about my ancestry. I actually learn a lot on the trail from people who think they’re related to me, and we kind of share notes. But as far back as I can really go, my father’s dad was a mechanic and my dad was a police officer, and my dad’s dream was that I would be the first in the family to go to college. So, I imagine that if they came to the United States at the turn of the century, that, like many immigrants at that time, they came to America to seek what I try and make sure is still available, which is the idea that if you work hard, it adds up to you doing better. No matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, and dreaming bigger for your kids.","Oh, there are a lot of different pieces to this story. On my father’s side, my father’s grandfather came over as a boy from Europe and met my father’s grandmother, who was also European, and they ended up farming in Missouri and then ultimately in the territory of Oklahoma. My great-grandfather helped two of his sons set up what were called hardware businesses in little towns in Oklahoma — Wetumka, Oklahoma, and Sallisaw, Oklahoma. And those stayed in the family, the one in Wetumka for another generation. First my daddy and then my Uncle Jack worked there. But they’ve both gone out now.","All four of my grandparents came from Russia and Poland, that area there. My grandfather had been conscripted in Russia for service for 25 years. Jews were conscripted for 25 years of service. My father’s mother was pregnant with him when she crossed on the boat over. He was born here. The story of my family and its immigration to the United States is one of those very typical, but very moving, stories of immigrants who came with very, very little and found everything.","My parents immigrated to the United States in the 1960s. They were both students. My father got his Ph.D. in physics at U.C. Berkeley. My mother was studying math and statistics at U.C. Berkeley, and then they met. My father wooed my mother, told her she’d never have to wash test tubes again, and then they got married right after they graduated from U.C. Berkeley in the late ’60s. So they arrived as students."
